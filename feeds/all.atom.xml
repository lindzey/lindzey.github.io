&lt;p&gt;Don Blankenship's research group at UTIG has been collecting geophysical data in Antarctica for decades.
Each season, we hire &lt;a href="http://www.borekair.com/"&gt;Kenn Borek Air&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-1-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-1" title=" KBA operates most of the non-military planes in Antarctica. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to operate one of their modified airplanes, stuff it full of sensors, and fly around Antarctica.
This post attempts to give a tour of the hardware involved, with an emphasis on its scientific purpose and a detour through Antarctic logistics.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;Why aerogeophysics?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/AntarcticaUSA.jpg" alt="credit: NASA" title="credit: NASA"&gt;
&lt;!--  captions fail with slashes. Argh. "credit: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/icebridge/multimedia/fall11/antarctica-US.html" %} --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antarctica is huge and hard to access.
While some types of data require in situ measurements (and are collected by overland traverses or teams dropped off by helicopter), the most efficient way to obtain basic information about the thickness of the ice and properties of the rock underneath it is to mount sensors in an airplane and start flying.
&lt;!-- Our group uses lasers to measure how quickly the ice surface elevation is changing, radar to measure its thickness, and gravity &amp; magnetics to characterize the density and type of rock underneath the ice. --&gt;
This type of mapping is inherently 1D in nature - we obtain very dense observations along a flight line, then interpolate tens of kilometers between the lines to create a map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/bedmap_distances.jpg" alt="Bedmap2 data coverage - black lines are from ice-penetrating radar. Image from Fretwell et al. 2013" title="Bedmap2 data coverage - black lines are from ice-penetrating radar. Image from Fretwell et al. 2013" width="315"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/all_UTIG_0.png" alt="UTIG radar coverage" title="UTIG radar coverage" width="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left plot above shows everwhere that BEDMAP2&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-2-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-2" title=" BEDMAP2 was an effort to integrate all the available data into maps of Antarctica's bedrock and ice thickness: Fretwell, P., Pritchard, H.

has data.
Almost all of the black lines represent a single flight line.
The densest (apparently solid) regions of black lines correspond to grids with 5km line spacing.
The right plot shows where my research group has flown over the past few decades.
Until this season, there were places where the closest measurement was hundreds of kilometers away.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-3-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-3" title=" There may still be such places, since I haven't seen an updated map, but I was involved in a project that filled in the biggest hole. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The airplane (and logistics)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research group currently uses WWII-era DC-3s,&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-4-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-4" title=" I'll interchangeably refer to these airplanes as DC-3s and Baslers. DC-3 was the original designation; Basler is the name of a company that takes these old airplanes and entirely refurbishes them for Arctic/Antarctic work. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
like the one in the picture at the start of this post.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-5-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-5" title=" JKB, the airplane shown in many off these photos, was used in WWII. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
We've used these since 2007. All through the 1990's and early 2000's, they used a Twin Otter (below).
Conceptually, not much has changed - while we're continually upgrading the instruments, the same types of data have been being collected for over 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/sjb.jpg" alt="Twin Otter SJB; Credit: Matt Fields-Johnson" title="Twin Otter SJB; Credit: Matt Fields-Johnson" width="500"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each season is slightly different, but a common pattern is to ship everything to a larger coastal station (McMurdo or Casey), do our setup and test flights from there, then fly to another base or field camp or series of bases closer to where we want to collect data, spend anywhere from a few days to a month at each spot, then head back to the bigger station for deconfiguration and getting home.
Cargo usually travels to Antarctica on an airplane and returns on an icebreaker,&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-6-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-6" title=" The boat is obviously preferable and cheaper, but our field seasons typically begin in October or November when there's still too much sea ice for even an icebreaker to make it to the stations. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
while humans usually travel both ways in a C-17 or LC-130&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-7-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-7" title=" I thought the C-17 was uncomfortable until I got to ride in the LC-130. Get friendly with the people across from you! If you're really lucky, you might get a spot in the Australian Airbus, where you're served real food and have a whole row of seats to yourself. At least on the military planes you can visit the cockpit, but if you want a view from the cabin, you'll have to wait your turn at one of about 4 tiny windows. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
operated by the Air National Guard flying to and from Christchurch, New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may have mentioned stuffing the airplane full:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/transit_racks1-4.jpg" alt="Transit flight, rack1-3" title="Transit flight, rack1-3" width="340"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/rack4_pcl.jpg" alt="Transit flight, rack 4 and PCL" title="Transit flight, rack 4 and PCL" width="340"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above images are from transit flights, when we had way more people and baggage than for normal survey operations.
The right photo was taken looking from the center of the plane towards the back.
In it, we can see part of rack 4 (used for HF radar electronics), the photon counting lidar with its control laptop&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-8-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-8" title=" Sadly, it would appear that this temperamental instrument is only collecting noise in this image. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
on top, and the curtain that separates the heated part of the plane from the cargo doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a similar location but looking forward (and taken on a non-transit flight!) we get a nice look at the racks in the front half of the airplane:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/racks1-3.jpg" alt="racks 1-3, looking forwards"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting at the cockpit, we have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rack 1 - operator interface, VHF amplifier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rack 2 - VHF radar electronics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;black box - gravimeter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rack 3 - gravimeter electronics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes an absolute minimum of 2 days to install all of this, several more for test flights to make sure everything works, and a very full day at the end of the season to strip it all out and start packing to go home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/kevin_and_john.jpg" alt="Kevin and John, our pilots last season" title="Kevin and John, our pilots last season"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any Kenn Borek airplane comes with 3 people dedicated to its operation: a mechanic (who is usually waiting back at the station), a pilot, and a copilot.
Here are Kevin (left) and John (right), our pilots last season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/refueling_dmc.jpg" alt="Refueling at Dome C" title="Refueling at Dome C"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find that the DC-3 has the best tradeoff for fuel burned per line-km of data collected.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-9-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-9" title="     In addition to the DC-3s and Twin Otters, other groups have used LC-130s and P-3s to collect radar sounding data. They're bigger, fly faster, and burn more fuel.     " class="simple-footnote"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
This airplane burns ~1000&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-10-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-10" title=" This varies dramatically with elevation; we get significantly better than this flying over the Antarctic Plateau, and worse around the coast. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
pounds per hour,&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-11-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-11" title="     If you're at a coastal station, fuel is brought in on an ice breaker, and is less of a constraint. If you're inland, that fuel is either brought in via a traverse (huge logistical operation) or flown in on LC-130s. Last season, at WAIS divide, the United States Antarctic Program used LC-130s to bring us fuel. They burn 3000 pounds of fuel an hour, and each delivery run from McMurdo provides enough fuel for ~3 of our survey flights.     " class="simple-footnote"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
travels at a nominal cruising speed of 160 knots, and has an endurance of ~6.5 hours in survey configuration.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-12-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-12" title="     Endurance is primarily a function of how much fuel can be carried. The upper limit is neither the volume of the tanks nor the maximum weight that can get airborne - it's the maximum weight that the airplane can safely land with, if an emergency landing were required just after takeoff. Nobody is going to be happy if you dump fuel over Antarctica. This means that each additional passenger costs ~15 minutes of extremely expensive survey time, and has been known to be a factor in deciding which additional instruments to install. Do you want the full suite of available instruments, or do you want an additional 30 minutes of survey time in order to reach that geologically interesting hole in the map?     " class="simple-footnote"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
So, for every day of good weather, we can get up to 2000 line-km of data.
If the weather has been bad and the pilots have extra hours available, we might do two 5-hour flights rather than a single 6.5 hour one, but that's the maximum for a single flight crew.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-13-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-13" title="     Pilots have legally- and contractually-mandated maximum duty day lengths, days off, maximum hours in the air per day, and rolling weekly/monthly flight hour maximums.     " class="simple-footnote"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/flying_weather.jpg" alt="not flying weather" title="not flying weather"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antarctic weather is usually the biggest challenge to successfully flying all of the survey lines that we've planned.
At a rough estimate, we're only able to fly 1/2 of the days when the airplane is available.
The biggest worry here is the ability to land.
When you're using snow for a runway, it doesn't take much in the way of clouds or fog to ruin all contrast.
Add a few more clouds or some snow falling from the sky as in the picture above, and it can be hard to find the horizon when you're just walking around.
Clouds are also a problem because of the potential for the wings - or worse, the radar antennas - to ice up.
Where we were operating last season, there were no good alternative runways, which meant that we were only able to fly when the weather was forecast to be pristine for the next ~8 hours.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-14-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-14" title=" This was … tough. The field camp was at an ice divide, meaning that weather systems could blow in from any of three directions, with very hard-to-predict timing. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have everything installed and are airborne, what data are we collecting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;VHF Radar&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/installing_antenna.jpg" alt="Installing VHF antennas on MKB" title="Installing VHF antennas on MKB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most visible external modifications that we make to the airplane are the antennas installed under each wing for the VHF radar.
While the receiver electronics have changed multiple times since then, these antennas are the same ones that were used back in the 1970's for some of the first ice-penetrating radar surveys of Antarctica.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-15-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-15" title=" That was before GPS, so the positioning was only good to ~5km, and the radar data was recorded photographically, not digitally! The technology didn't exist to digitize the received signals and write them to disk like we do now. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Both antennas are used for transmitting the 8kW signal and for receiving the much weaker echoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/ASB.JKB1a.R10Wa_full.png" alt="" example="" asb.jkb1a.r10wa""="" transect:="" title=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use this 60MHz radar to get a 2D cross-section of the ice.
An example of the data is shown above - you can clearly see the ice surface, layers within the ice, and mountains underneath.
I've previously talked about &lt;a href="/blog/2015/07/27/a-brief-introduction-to-ice-penetrating-radar/"&gt;interpreting the radargrams&lt;/a&gt;, so I won't go further into it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most basic science done with data from this sensor is determining the topography underneath kilometers of ice.
Among other things, this is important for calculating how much potential sea level change is locked up in Antarctica, and how stable the ice sheet is likely to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/Fretwell2013BedmapImage.png" alt="Bedmap2 image from Fretwell et al. 2013" title="Bedmap2 image from Fretwell et al. 2013" width="610"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are proud of having collected a significant portion of the line-km that were used to create Bedmap2.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-16-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-16" title=" Fretwell, P., Pritchard, H.

The image above shows the bed elevation - note how much of the continent is actually lower than sea level!&lt;/p&gt;

This type of data has also been used to infer that East Antarctica has dramatically fluctuated in size in the past.[ref]
Young, D. A., Wright, A. P., Roberts, J. L., Warner, R. C., Young, N. W., Greenbaum, J. S., Schroeder, D. M., Holt, J. W., Sugden, D. E., Blankenship, D. D., and Others (2011). A dynamic early East Antarctic Ice Sheet suggested by ice-covered fjord landscapes. Nature, 474(7349):72–75.
[/ref]
This fluctuation is particularly interesting because East Antarctica contains the majority of the ice in Antarctica,[ref]
According to Fretwell2013, EAIS contains 53.3m of sea level rise, of which 19.2 is ice grounded below sea level. WAIS has 4.3 total, of which 3.4 is grounded below sea level.
[/ref] and had been thought to be more stable than West Antarctica.
The left image above shows the topography in the Aurora Subglacial Basin, and the set of differently-oriented U-shaped valleys was taken as evidence of different ice sheet configurations, with different ice flow directions and coastline configurations.
The hypothesized coastlines are shown in the image above right.

--&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;HF radar&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the 60MHz VHF radar, we also field a 2MHz HF radar.
Rather than antennas under the wings, we unspool a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sim\)&lt;/span&gt;60m long wire antenna through a port in the floor.
My attempts to get a clear picture of this antenna deployed while in flight have failed, so the best I have is one of Jamin preparing to reel the antenna back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/hf_interior.jpg" the="" jsg="" title="" of="" pic="" in""="" alt="" reeling="" antenna=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main factors determining how deep of a bed we can detect is the radar signal's attenuation as it passes through the ice.
Both warmer ice and saltier ice lead to higher losses, as does a rough surface that causes scattering.
In some conditions, energy at 2MHz penetrates better than energy at 60MHz, at the cost of poorer vertical resultion due to the much longer wavelength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We primarily fly this dual-frequency setup as a testbed for the REASON instrument that will be on the next mission to Europa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Gravity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm continually amazed that we're able to measure accelarations accurately enough to infer underwater topography based on local changes in gravitational acceleration.
Stationary instruments on the ground can measure to a precision of ~5uGal.
For context, the gravity field changes by ~300uGal/m as you get farther from the center of the earth, and 1G = 9.8m/s2 = 980Gal.
From a moving platform with turbulance, we'll get precision on the order of a few mGal.
This requires integrating many measurements in order to get a usable signal to noise ratio, which means that we're only able to detect features on the scale of ~5km.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-19-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-19" title=" For a fixed sampling rate, the slower you fly the better your data will be. We're excited about the potential for mounting gravimeters on helicopters to get even higher-resolution data! Lower is also better, because you're closer to the source. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
The main complication when interpreting gravity data is that you're actually measuring differences in density.
If you assume less-dense sedimentary rocks underneath the water, you're going to wind up balancing them out with a shallower water column, while if you assume denser rocks, you'll infer deeper water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamin Greenbaum recently published a paper&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-20-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-20" title=" Greenbaum, J. S., Blankenship, D. D., Young, D. A., Richter, T. G., Aitken, A. R. A., Legresy, B., Schroeder, D. M., Roberts, J. L., Warner, R. C., van Ommen, T. D., and Siegert, M. J. (2015). Increased Ocean Access to Totten Glacier, East Antarctica. Nature Geos. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
improving the estimates of the cavity shape underneath the Totten Ice Shelf.
His inferred geometry is shown below on the left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/Greenbaum2015.jpg" alt="Totten bathymetry from Greenbaum et al. 2015" title="Totten bathymetry from Greenbaum et al. 2015"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an important result because he showed that the ocean is deep enough that warm deep water is able to enter the cavity, which could explain why the glacier's surface is lowering so quickly.
It was also a significant improvement over the previous bathymetry - in the figure above right, you can see the old best-guess bathymetry as a dashed line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Magnetics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/mag_boom.jpg" alt="Magnetometer boom" title="Magnetometer boom, getting that instrument as far away as possible from all the metal on the plane!"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have two magnetometers on the plane.
One is mounted inside near the cameras and and measures the 3 dimensional magnetic field vector.
A much more precise one measuring only the magnitude is stuck way at the end of the tail boom, shown above.
The idea behind this arrangement is that we want to understand how the airplane's orientation and interaction with the earth's magnetic field affects the measured field (you can see turns very clearly in the interior data), but we want the most accurate reading possible, taken as far away as possible from all the metal in the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/base_mag.jpg" alt="basemag" title="Magnetometer setup back at camp" width="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also record the magnetic field at a base station.
The above image shows the magnetometer housing and its solar charger.
Data from this is used to determine when to fly (it gets noisier at certain times of day) and then compared with the in-flight data to determine an anomaly.
Any signal that's different between the base and the airplane can be assumed to be from local topography, not the earth's temporally varying magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Igneous rocks tend to be magnetic, with their internal field aligned with what the earth's field was when the rock formed, while ice and sedimentary rocks are not magnetic.
This means that we can figure out what type of rocks are underneath the ice based on the magnetic signal that we observe!
This process has been used to infer the presence of shallow volcanoes underneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.
This matches very well with other observations indicating that the ice sheet is warmer and melting more than you'd expect for somewhere with globally average geothermal flux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determining the depth of the magnetic rocks can also be useful for interpreting gravity data.
If something's magnetic, you know that it's denser than sediments would be, and anything that helps you constrain the density model will improve the gravity inversion.
Depth can be inferred from the signal's gradient - the deeper a feature is, the smoother the resulting signal will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cameras&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/cam_las_windows.jpg" alt="Image of bottom of airplane, with las and cam labeled. If can see it, also label where HF antenna comes out" title="Image of bottom of airplane, with las and cam labeled. If can see it, also label where HF antenna comes out"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't use camera data directly to answer any science questions,&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-21-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-21" title=" We have recently learned that whale biologists are seriously interested in our data any time we fly over open water (which we do with some frequency for gravity data). It turns out that they've been fielding airplanes just to get the same type of imagery that we collect as a routine part of our operations. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but the pictures are useful for providing context for other data.
This has included trying to figure out why we were missing laser data: Was it cloudy out? Were we in a heavily crevassed region? Were we over water?
It has also been used to validate radar-derived surface roughness estimates.
The below figure is from a paper by Cyril Grima&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-22-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-22" title=" Grima, C., Schroeder, D. M., Blankenship, D.

" class="simple-footnote"&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
and shows roughness parameters derived from a statistical examination of the returned radar pulse shape.
The extracted parameters show an excellent qualitative agreement with the imagery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use lasers to very accurately measure the surface elevation of the ice sheet.
Even where it is changing most rapidly, these changes are measured in meters per year, and our goal is to be able to detect changes of 5cm per year.
From 2003-2009, ICESat collected laser altimetry from space, leading to a detailed map of where elevations are changing across Antarctica and Greenland.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-23-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-23" title=" Pritchard, H. D., Arthern, R. J., Vaughan, D. G., and Edwards, L. A. (2009). Extensive dynamic thinning on the margins of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.

&lt;p&gt;However, ICESat failed in 2009, and its replacement has not yet been launched.
So, a number of groups (including ours) have been reflying ICESat tracks in an effort to extend the temporal record and hopefully connect it to ICESat II.
Our system, ALAMO&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-24-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-24" title=" Young, D. A., Lindzey, L. E., Blankenship, D. D., Greenbaum, J. S., de Gorordo, A. G., Kempf, S. D., Roberts, J. L., Warner, R. C., van Ommen, T., Siegert, M. J., and le Meur, E. (2014).

" class="simple-footnote"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, includes an off-the-shelf single-beam Riegl altimeter, which is well characterized and used to determine the range to the surface.
We also have a more temperamental scanning photon counting lidar that is a protopype of what will be on ICESat II.
Its data points are dense enough to map individual buildings in McMurdo (below), but we mostly use its data to determine the ice's surface slope, which is important when trying to compare two slightly offset repeat flights of the same line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/mcm_411_375.png" alt="PCL data from Flying over McMurdo" title="PCL data from Flying over McMurdo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;GPS, IMU&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have 4 GPS antennas mounted outside the plane: at the center, the tail, and on each wing.
These are used to get absolute position in space.
The IMUs measure accelations, and give us a very accurate orientation estimate - we have a little MEMs one mounted on rack 2, and a more precise one mounted directly to the PCL.
After post-processing, we typically know our position to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sim\)&lt;/span&gt;2cm and our orientation to milli-radian accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we don't use this as science data in and of itself, knowing the airplane's exact position is absolutely crucial for processing the other data.
For example, the laser altimetry measurements are basically a 600m lever arm, and if we want to know the position of the end of that arm to centimeter accuracy, orientation matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Outside Air Temperature, Pressure&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more metadata for our operation than science data.
 No major publications result from this, but I did use them to validate a correction for the speed of light in air, which primarily depends on pressure and temperature.
I was utterly dumbfounded when I realized that the difference in conditions between the coast and inland domes could result in a 10cm bias in the altimetry data!
We don't consistently collect temperature and pressure data, but we always know our altitude.
So, I needed to check that an altitude-based approximation to the speed of light would remove any geographical bias in our data.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-25-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-25" title=" I was impressed by my research group's data management discipline when I was able to dig up and painlessly use 20+ year old data to do this analysis!

BEDMAP2 was an effort to integrate all the available data into maps of Antarctica's bedrock and ice thickness: Fretwell, P., Pritchard, H. D., Vaughan, D. G., Bamber, J. L., Barrand, N.

There may still be such places, since I haven't seen an updated map, but I was involved in a project that filled in the biggest hole.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-3-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-4"&gt;
I'll interchangeably refer to these airplanes as DC-3s and Baslers.
DC-3 was the original designation; Basler is the name of a company that takes these old airplanes and entirely refurbishes them for Arctic/Antarctic work.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-4-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-5"&gt;
JKB, the airplane shown in many off these photos, was used in WWII.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-5-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-6"&gt;
The boat is obviously preferable and cheaper, but our field seasons typically begin in October or November when there's still too much sea ice for even an icebreaker to make it to the stations.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-6-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-7"&gt;
I thought the C-17 was uncomfortable until I got to ride in the LC-130. Get friendly with the people across from you! If you're really lucky, you might get a spot in the Australian Airbus, where you're served real food and have a whole row of seats to yourself. At least on the military planes you can visit the cockpit, but if you want a view from the cabin, you'll have to wait your turn at one of about 4 tiny windows.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-7-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-8"&gt;
Sadly, it would appear that this temperamental instrument is only collecting noise in this image.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-8-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-9"&gt;
    In addition to the DC-3s and Twin Otters, other groups have used LC-130s and P-3s to collect radar sounding data.
They're bigger, fly faster, and burn more fuel.
     &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-9-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-10"&gt;
This varies dramatically with elevation; we get significantly better than this flying over the Antarctic Plateau, and worse around the coast.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-10-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-11"&gt;
    If you're at a coastal station, fuel is brought in on an ice breaker, and is less of a constraint.
If you're inland, that fuel is either brought in via a traverse (huge logistical operation) or flown in on LC-130s.
Last season, at WAIS divide, the United States Antarctic Program used LC-130s to bring us fuel.
They burn 3000 pounds of fuel an hour, and each delivery run from McMurdo provides enough fuel for ~3 of our survey flights.
     &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-11-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-12"&gt;
    Endurance is primarily a function of how much fuel can be carried.
The upper limit is neither the volume of the tanks nor the maximum weight that can get airborne - it's the maximum weight that the airplane can safely land with, if an emergency landing were required just after takeoff.
Nobody is going to be happy if you dump fuel over Antarctica.
This means that each additional passenger costs ~15 minutes of extremely expensive survey time, and has been known to be a factor in deciding which additional instruments to install.
Do you want the full suite of available instruments, or do you want an additional 30 minutes of survey time in order to reach that geologically interesting hole in the map?
     &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-12-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-13"&gt;
    Pilots have legally- and contractually-mandated maximum duty day lengths, days off, maximum hours in the air per day, and rolling weekly/monthly flight hour maximums.
     &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-13-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-14"&gt;
This was … tough.
The field camp was at an ice divide, meaning that weather systems could blow in from any of three directions, with very hard-to-predict timing.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-14-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-15"&gt;
That was before GPS, so the positioning was only good to ~5km, and the radar data was recorded photographically, not digitally! The technology didn't exist to digitize the received signals and write them to disk like we do now.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-15-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-16"&gt;

NASA has produced some very fun visualizations of the improvement bewteen BEDMAP and BEDMAP2, as well as the ice surface / bed topography.
We collected some of the data as a part of NASA's Operation Ice Bridge (mostly in East Antarctica).
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/antarctic-map.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;

Of course, it was obsolete as soon as it came out, as everybody continues to collect more data.

For a fixed sampling rate, the slower you fly the better your data will be. We're excited about the potential for mounting gravimeters on helicopters to get even higher-resolution data! Lower is also better, because you're closer to the source.

&lt;p&gt;Don Blankenship's research group at UTIG has been collecting geophysical data in Antarctica for decades.
Each season, we hire &lt;a href="http://www.borekair.com/"&gt;Kenn Borek Air&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-1-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-1" title=" KBA operates most of the non-military planes in Antarctica. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to operate one of their modified airplanes, stuff it full of sensors, and fly around Antarctica.
This post attempts to give a tour of the hardware involved, with an emphasis on its scientific purpose and a detour through Antarctic logistics.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;Why aerogeophysics?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/AntarcticaUSA.jpg" alt="credit: NASA" title="credit: NASA"&gt;
&lt;!--  captions fail with slashes. Argh. "credit: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/icebridge/multimedia/fall11/antarctica-US.html" %} --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antarctica is huge and hard to access.
While some types of data require in situ measurements (and are collected by overland traverses or teams dropped off by helicopter), the most efficient way to obtain basic information about the thickness of the ice and properties of the rock underneath it is to mount sensors in an airplane and start flying.
&lt;!-- Our group uses lasers to measure how quickly the ice surface elevation is changing, radar to measure its thickness, and gravity &amp; magnetics to characterize the density and type of rock underneath the ice. --&gt;
This type of mapping is inherently 1D in nature - we obtain very dense observations along a flight line, then interpolate tens of kilometers between the lines to create a map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/bedmap_distances.jpg" alt="Bedmap2 data coverage - black lines are from ice-penetrating radar. Image from Fretwell et al. 2013" title="Bedmap2 data coverage - black lines are from ice-penetrating radar. Image from Fretwell et al. 2013" width="315"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The left plot above shows everwhere that BEDMAP2&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-2-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-2" title=" BEDMAP2 was an effort to integrate all the available data into maps of Antarctica's bedrock and ice thickness: Fretwell, P., Pritchard, H.

has data.
Almost all of the black lines represent a single flight line.
The densest (apparently solid) regions of black lines correspond to grids with 5km line spacing.
The right plot shows where my research group has flown over the past few decades.
Until this season, there were places where the closest measurement was hundreds of kilometers away.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-3-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-3" title=" There may still be such places, since I haven't seen an updated map, but I was involved in a project that filled in the biggest hole.

&lt;h4&gt;The airplane (and logistics)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research group currently uses WWII-era DC-3s,&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-4-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-4" title=" I'll interchangeably refer to these airplanes as DC-3s and Baslers. DC-3 was the original designation; Basler is the name of a company that takes these old airplanes and entirely refurbishes them for Arctic/Antarctic work. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
like the one in the picture at the start of this post.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-5-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-5" title=" JKB, the airplane shown in many off these photos, was used in WWII. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
We've used these since 2007. All through the 1990's and early 2000's, they used a Twin Otter (below).
Conceptually, not much has changed - while we're continually upgrading the instruments, the same types of data have been being collected for over 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/sjb.jpg" alt="Twin Otter SJB; Credit: Matt Fields-Johnson" title="Twin Otter SJB; Credit: Matt Fields-Johnson" width="500"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each season is slightly different, but a common pattern is to ship everything to a larger coastal station (McMurdo or Casey), do our setup and test flights from there, then fly to another base or field camp or series of bases closer to where we want to collect data, spend anywhere from a few days to a month at each spot, then head back to the bigger station for deconfiguration and getting home.
Cargo usually travels to Antarctica on an airplane and returns on an icebreaker,&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-6-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-6" title=" The boat is obviously preferable and cheaper, but our field seasons typically begin in October or November when there's still too much sea ice for even an icebreaker to make it to the stations.

&lt;p&gt;The above images are from transit flights, when we had way more people and baggage than for normal survey operations.
The right photo was taken looking from the center of the plane towards the back.
In it, we can see part of rack 4 (used for HF radar electronics), the photon counting lidar with its control laptop&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-8-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-8" title=" Sadly, it would appear that this temperamental instrument is only collecting noise in this image. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
on top, and the curtain that separates the heated part of the plane from the cargo doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a similar location but looking forward (and taken on a non-transit flight!) we get a nice look at the racks in the front half of the airplane:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/racks1-3.jpg" alt="racks 1-3, looking forwards"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting at the cockpit, we have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rack 1 - operator interface, VHF amplifier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rack 2 - VHF radar electronics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;black box - gravimeter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rack 3 - gravimeter electronics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes an absolute minimum of 2 days to install all of this, several more for test flights to make sure everything works, and a very full day at the end of the season to strip it all out and start packing to go home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any Kenn Borek airplane comes with 3 people dedicated to its operation: a mechanic (who is usually waiting back at the station), a pilot, and a copilot.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/refueling_dmc.jpg" alt="Refueling at Dome C" title="Refueling at Dome C"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find that the DC-3 has the best tradeoff for fuel burned per line-km of data collected.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-9-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-9" title="     In addition to the DC-3s and Twin Otters, other groups have used LC-130s and P-3s to collect radar sounding data. They're bigger, fly faster, and burn more fuel.     " class="simple-footnote"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
This airplane burns ~1000&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-10-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-10" title=" This varies dramatically with elevation; we get significantly better than this flying over the Antarctic Plateau, and worse around the coast.

pounds per hour,&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-11-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-11" title="     If you're at a coastal station, fuel is brought in on an ice breaker, and is less of a constraint. If you're inland, that fuel is either brought in via a traverse (huge logistical operation) or flown in on LC-130s. Last season, at WAIS divide, the United States Antarctic Program used LC-130s to bring us fuel. They burn 3000 pounds of fuel an hour, and each delivery run from McMurdo provides enough fuel for ~3 of our survey flights.     " class="simple-footnote"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
travels at a nominal cruising speed of 160 knots, and has an endurance of ~6.5 hours in survey configuration.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-12-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-12" title="     Endurance is primarily a function of how much fuel can be carried. The upper limit is neither the volume of the tanks nor the maximum weight that can get airborne - it's the maximum weight that the airplane can safely land with, if an emergency landing were required just after takeoff. Nobody is going to be happy if you dump fuel over Antarctica. This means that each additional passenger costs ~15 minutes of extremely expensive survey time, and has been known to be a factor in deciding which additional instruments to install. Do you want the full suite of available instruments, or do you want an additional 30 minutes of survey time in order to reach that geologically interesting hole in the map?     " class="simple-footnote"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
So, for every day of good weather, we can get up to 2000 line-km of data.
If the weather has been bad and the pilots have extra hours available, we might do two 5-hour flights rather than a single 6.5 hour one, but that's the maximum for a single flight crew.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-13-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-13" title="     Pilots have legally- and contractually-mandated maximum duty day lengths, days off, maximum hours in the air per day, and rolling weekly/monthly flight hour maximums.     " class="simple-footnote"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/flying_weather.jpg" alt="not flying weather" title="not flying weather"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antarctic weather is usually the biggest challenge to successfully flying all of the survey lines that we've planned.
At a rough estimate, we're only able to fly 1/2 of the days when the airplane is available.
The biggest worry here is the ability to land.
When you're using snow for a runway, it doesn't take much in the way of clouds or fog to ruin all contrast.
Add a few more clouds or some snow falling from the sky as in the picture above, and it can be hard to find the horizon when you're just walking around.
Clouds are also a problem because of the potential for the wings - or worse, the radar antennas - to ice up.
Where we were operating last season, there were no good alternative runways, which meant that we were only able to fly when the weather was forecast to be pristine for the next ~8 hours.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-14-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-14" title=" This was … tough. The field camp was at an ice divide, meaning that weather systems could blow in from any of three directions, with very hard-to-predict timing. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have everything installed and are airborne, what data are we collecting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;VHF Radar&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/installing_antenna.jpg" alt="Installing VHF antennas on MKB" title="Installing VHF antennas on MKB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most visible external modifications that we make to the airplane are the antennas installed under each wing for the VHF radar.
While the receiver electronics have changed multiple times since then, these antennas are the same ones that were used back in the 1970's for some of the first ice-penetrating radar surveys of Antarctica.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-15-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-15" title=" That was before GPS, so the positioning was only good to ~5km, and the radar data was recorded photographically, not digitally! The technology didn't exist to digitize the received signals and write them to disk like we do now. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Both antennas are used for transmitting the 8kW signal and for receiving the much weaker echoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/ASB.JKB1a.R10Wa_full.png" alt="" example="" asb.jkb1a.r10wa""="" transect:="" title=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use this 60MHz radar to get a 2D cross-section of the ice.
An example of the data is shown above - you can clearly see the ice surface, layers within the ice, and mountains underneath.
I've previously talked about &lt;a href="/blog/2015/07/27/a-brief-introduction-to-ice-penetrating-radar/"&gt;interpreting the radargrams&lt;/a&gt;, so I won't go further into it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most basic science done with data from this sensor is determining the topography underneath kilometers of ice.
Among other things, this is important for calculating how much potential sea level change is locked up in Antarctica, and how stable the ice sheet is likely to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/Fretwell2013BedmapImage.png" alt="Bedmap2 image from Fretwell et al. 2013" title="Bedmap2 image from Fretwell et al. 2013" width="610"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This type of data has also been used to infer that East Antarctica has dramatically fluctuated in size in the past.[ref]
Young, D. A., Wright, A. P., Roberts, J. L., Warner, R. C., Young, N. W., Greenbaum, J. S., Schroeder, D. M., Holt, J. W., Sugden, D. E., Blankenship, D. D., and Others (2011). A dynamic early East Antarctic Ice Sheet suggested by ice-covered fjord landscapes. Nature, 474(7349):72–75.
[/ref]
This fluctuation is particularly interesting because East Antarctica contains the majority of the ice in Antarctica,[ref]
According to Fretwell2013, EAIS contains 53.3m of sea level rise, of which 19.2 is ice grounded below sea level. WAIS has 4.3 total, of which 3.4 is grounded below sea level.
[/ref] and had been thought to be more stable than West Antarctica.
The left image above shows the topography in the Aurora Subglacial Basin, and the set of differently-oriented U-shaped valleys was taken as evidence of different ice sheet configurations, with different ice flow directions and coastline configurations.
The hypothesized coastlines are shown in the image above right.

--&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;HF radar&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the 60MHz VHF radar, we also field a 2MHz HF radar.
Rather than antennas under the wings, we unspool a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sim\)&lt;/span&gt;60m long wire antenna through a port in the floor.
My attempts to get a clear picture of this antenna deployed while in flight have failed, so the best I have is one of Jamin preparing to reel the antenna back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/hf_interior.jpg" the="" jsg="" title="" of="" pic="" in""="" alt="" reeling="" antenna=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main factors determining how deep of a bed we can detect is the radar signal's attenuation as it passes through the ice.
Both warmer ice and saltier ice lead to higher losses, as does a rough surface that causes scattering.
In some conditions, energy at 2MHz penetrates better than energy at 60MHz, at the cost of poorer vertical resultion due to the much longer wavelength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We primarily fly this dual-frequency setup as a testbed for the REASON instrument that will be on the next mission to Europa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Gravity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm continually amazed that we're able to measure accelarations accurately enough to infer underwater topography based on local changes in gravitational acceleration.
Stationary instruments on the ground can measure to a precision of ~5uGal.
For context, the gravity field changes by ~300uGal/m as you get farther from the center of the earth, and 1G = 9.8m/s2 = 980Gal.
From a moving platform with turbulance, we'll get precision on the order of a few mGal.
This requires integrating many measurements in order to get a usable signal to noise ratio, which means that we're only able to detect features on the scale of ~5km.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-19-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-19" title=" For a fixed sampling rate, the slower you fly the better your data will be. We're excited about the potential for mounting gravimeters on helicopters to get even higher-resolution data! Lower is also better, because you're closer to the source. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
The main complication when interpreting gravity data is that you're actually measuring differences in density.
If you assume less-dense sedimentary rocks underneath the water, you're going to wind up balancing them out with a shallower water column, while if you assume denser rocks, you'll infer deeper water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamin Greenbaum recently published a paper&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-20-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-20" title=" Greenbaum, J. S., Blankenship, D. D., Young, D. A., Richter, T. G., Aitken, A. R. A., Legresy, B., Schroeder, D. M., Roberts, J. L., Warner, R. C., van Ommen, T. D., and Siegert, M. J. (2015). Increased Ocean Access to Totten Glacier, East Antarctica. Nature Geos. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
improving the estimates of the cavity shape underneath the Totten Ice Shelf.
His inferred geometry is shown below on the left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/Greenbaum2015.jpg" alt="Totten bathymetry from Greenbaum et al. 2015" title="Totten bathymetry from Greenbaum et al. 2015"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an important result because he showed that the ocean is deep enough that warm deep water is able to enter the cavity, which could explain why the glacier's surface is lowering so quickly.
It was also a significant improvement over the previous bathymetry - in the figure above right, you can see the old best-guess bathymetry as a dashed line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Magnetics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/mag_boom.jpg" alt="Magnetometer boom" title="Magnetometer boom, getting that instrument as far away as possible from all the metal on the plane!"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have two magnetometers on the plane.
One is mounted inside near the cameras and and measures the 3 dimensional magnetic field vector.
A much more precise one measuring only the magnitude is stuck way at the end of the tail boom, shown above.
The idea behind this arrangement is that we want to understand how the airplane's orientation and interaction with the earth's magnetic field affects the measured field (you can see turns very clearly in the interior data), but we want the most accurate reading possible, taken as far away as possible from all the metal in the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/base_mag.jpg" alt="basemag" title="Magnetometer setup back at camp" width="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also record the magnetic field at a base station.
The above image shows the magnetometer housing and its solar charger.
Data from this is used to determine when to fly (it gets noisier at certain times of day) and then compared with the in-flight data to determine an anomaly.
Any signal that's different between the base and the airplane can be assumed to be from local topography, not the earth's temporally varying magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Igneous rocks tend to be magnetic, with their internal field aligned with what the earth's field was when the rock formed, while ice and sedimentary rocks are not magnetic.
This means that we can figure out what type of rocks are underneath the ice based on the magnetic signal that we observe!
This process has been used to infer the presence of shallow volcanoes underneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.
This matches very well with other observations indicating that the ice sheet is warmer and melting more than you'd expect for somewhere with globally average geothermal flux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determining the depth of the magnetic rocks can also be useful for interpreting gravity data.
If something's magnetic, you know that it's denser than sediments would be, and anything that helps you constrain the density model will improve the gravity inversion.
Depth can be inferred from the signal's gradient - the deeper a feature is, the smoother the resulting signal will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cameras&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/cam_las_windows.jpg" alt="Image of bottom of airplane, with las and cam labeled. If can see it, also label where HF antenna comes out" title="Image of bottom of airplane, with las and cam labeled. If can see it, also label where HF antenna comes out"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't use camera data directly to answer any science questions,&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-21-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-21" title=" We have recently learned that whale biologists are seriously interested in our data any time we fly over open water (which we do with some frequency for gravity data). It turns out that they've been fielding airplanes just to get the same type of imagery that we collect as a routine part of our operations. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but the pictures are useful for providing context for other data.
This has included trying to figure out why we were missing laser data: Was it cloudy out? Were we in a heavily crevassed region? Were we over water?
It has also been used to validate radar-derived surface roughness estimates.
The below figure is from a paper by Cyril Grima&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-22-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-22" title=" Grima, C., Schroeder, D. M., Blankenship, D. D., and Young, D. A. (2014a). Planetary landing-zone reconnaissance using ice-penetrating radar data: Concept validation in Antarctica. Planetary and Space Science. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
and shows roughness parameters derived from a statistical examination of the returned radar pulse shape.
The extracted parameters show an excellent qualitative agreement with the imagery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/Grima2014_roughness1.jpg" alt="Qualitative validation of surface roughness from Grima et al. 2014" title="Qualitative validation of surface roughness from Grima et al. 2014" width="340"&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Laser altimetry&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use lasers to very accurately measure the surface elevation of the ice sheet.
Even where it is changing most rapidly, these changes are measured in meters per year, and our goal is to be able to detect changes of 5cm per year.
From 2003-2009, ICESat collected laser altimetry from space, leading to a detailed map of where elevations are changing across Antarctica and Greenland.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-23-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-23" title=" Pritchard, H. D., Arthern, R. J., Vaughan, D. G., and Edwards, L. A. (2009). Extensive dynamic thinning on the margins of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.

&lt;p&gt;However, ICESat failed in 2009, and its replacement has not yet been launched.
So, a number of groups (including ours) have been reflying ICESat tracks in an effort to extend the temporal record and hopefully connect it to ICESat II.
Our system, ALAMO&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-24-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-24" title=" Young, D. A., Lindzey, L. E., Blankenship, D. D., Greenbaum, J.

" class="simple-footnote"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, includes an off-the-shelf single-beam Riegl altimeter, which is well characterized and used to determine the range to the surface.
We also have a more temperamental scanning photon counting lidar that is a protopype of what will be on ICESat II.
Its data points are dense enough to map individual buildings in McMurdo (below), but we mostly use its data to determine the ice's surface slope, which is important when trying to compare two slightly offset repeat flights of the same line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/mcm_411_375.png" alt="PCL data from Flying over McMurdo" title="PCL data from Flying over McMurdo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;GPS, IMU&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have 4 GPS antennas mounted outside the plane: at the center, the tail, and on each wing.
These are used to get absolute position in space.
The IMUs measure accelations, and give us a very accurate orientation estimate - we have a little MEMs one mounted on rack 2, and a more precise one mounted directly to the PCL.
After post-processing, we typically know our position to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sim\)&lt;/span&gt;2cm and our orientation to milli-radian accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we don't use this as science data in and of itself, knowing the airplane's exact position is absolutely crucial for processing the other data.
For example, the laser altimetry measurements are basically a 600m lever arm, and if we want to know the position of the end of that arm to centimeter accuracy, orientation matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Outside Air Temperature, Pressure&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more metadata for our operation than science data.
 No major publications result from this, but I did use them to validate a correction for the speed of light in air, which primarily depends on pressure and temperature.
I was utterly dumbfounded when I realized that the difference in conditions between the coast and inland domes could result in a 10cm bias in the altimetry data!
We don't consistently collect temperature and pressure data, but we always know our altitude.
So, I needed to check that an altitude-based approximation to the speed of light would remove any geographical bias in our data.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-25-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-25" title=" I was impressed by my research group's data management discipline when I was able to dig up and painlessly use 20+ year old data to do this analysis!

KBA operates most of the non-military planes in Antarctica.

BEDMAP2 was an effort to integrate all the available data into maps of Antarctica's bedrock and ice thickness: Fretwell, P., Pritchard, H. D., Vaughan, D. G., Bamber, J. L., Barrand, N. E., Bell, R., Bianchi, C., Bingham, R. G., Blankenship, D. D., Casassa, G., and Others (2013). Bedmap2: improved ice bed, surface and thickness datasets for Antarctica. The Cryosphere, 7(1):375–393.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-2-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-3"&gt;
There may still be such places, since I haven't seen an updated map, but I was involved in a project that filled in the biggest hole.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-3-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-4"&gt;
I'll interchangeably refer to these airplanes as DC-3s and Baslers.
DC-3 was the original designation; Basler is the name of a company that takes these old airplanes and entirely refurbishes them for Arctic/Antarctic work.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-4-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-5"&gt;
JKB, the airplane shown in many off these photos, was used in WWII.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-5-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-6"&gt;
The boat is obviously preferable and cheaper, but our field seasons typically begin in October or November when there's still too much sea ice for even an icebreaker to make it to the stations.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-6-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-7"&gt;
I thought the C-17 was uncomfortable until I got to ride in the LC-130. Get friendly with the people across from you! If you're really lucky, you might get a spot in the Australian Airbus, where you're served real food and have a whole row of seats to yourself. At least on the military planes you can visit the cockpit, but if you want a view from the cabin, you'll have to wait your turn at one of about 4 tiny windows.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-7-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-8"&gt;
Sadly, it would appear that this temperamental instrument is only collecting noise in this image.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-8-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-9"&gt;
    In addition to the DC-3s and Twin Otters, other groups have used LC-130s and P-3s to collect radar sounding data.
They're bigger, fly faster, and burn more fuel.
     &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-9-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-10"&gt;
This varies dramatically with elevation; we get significantly better than this flying over the Antarctic Plateau, and worse around the coast.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-10-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-11"&gt;
    If you're at a coastal station, fuel is brought in on an ice breaker, and is less of a constraint.
If you're inland, that fuel is either brought in via a traverse (huge logistical operation) or flown in on LC-130s.
Last season, at WAIS divide, the United States Antarctic Program used LC-130s to bring us fuel.
They burn 3000 pounds of fuel an hour, and each delivery run from McMurdo provides enough fuel for ~3 of our survey flights.
     &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-11-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-12"&gt;
    Endurance is primarily a function of how much fuel can be carried.
The upper limit is neither the volume of the tanks nor the maximum weight that can get airborne - it's the maximum weight that the airplane can safely land with, if an emergency landing were required just after takeoff.
Nobody is going to be happy if you dump fuel over Antarctica.
This means that each additional passenger costs ~15 minutes of extremely expensive survey time, and has been known to be a factor in deciding which additional instruments to install.
Do you want the full suite of available instruments, or do you want an additional 30 minutes of survey time in order to reach that geologically interesting hole in the map?
     &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-12-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-13"&gt;
    Pilots have legally- and contractually-mandated maximum duty day lengths, days off, maximum hours in the air per day, and rolling weekly/monthly flight hour maximums.
     &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-13-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-14"&gt;
This was … tough.
The field camp was at an ice divide, meaning that weather systems could blow in from any of three directions, with very hard-to-predict timing.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-14-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-15"&gt;
That was before GPS, so the positioning was only good to ~5km, and the radar data was recorded photographically, not digitally! The technology didn't exist to digitize the received signals and write them to disk like we do now.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-15-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-16"&gt;
Fretwell, P., Pritchard, H. D., Vaughan, D. G., Bamber, J. L., Barrand, N. E., Bell, R., Bianchi, C., Bingham, R. G., Blankenship, D. D., Casassa, G., and Others (2013). Bedmap2: improved ice bed, surface and thickness datasets for Antarctica. The Cryosphere, 7(1):375–393.

NASA has produced some very fun visualizations of the improvement bewteen BEDMAP and BEDMAP2, as well as the ice surface / bed topography.
We collected some of the data as a part of NASA's Operation Ice Bridge (mostly in East Antarctica).
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/antarctic-map.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-17-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-18"&gt;
Of course, it was obsolete as soon as it came out, as everybody continues to collect more data.

For a fixed sampling rate, the slower you fly the better your data will be. We're excited about the potential for mounting gravimeters on helicopters to get even higher-resolution data! Lower is also better, because you're closer to the source.

&lt;p&gt;I woke up to hear the magic word “penguins” in the dorm hallway, so I grabbed my camera and ran down to the shore, which led to a lovely afternoon spent following them around the station.
This was all in accordance with my research group's official "penguin policy" stating that penguin sightings have priority over anything but a flight.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/zhongshan_penguins/penguins03.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Adelies were generally indifferent to our presence,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/zhongshan_penguins/penguin_reflection.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but when we started to leave for dinner, they followed ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/zhongshan_penguins/penguins02.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The others headed up the hill to the main building and dinner, but the penguins and I hung a right ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/zhongshan_penguins/penguins_seacans.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... in order to waddle through the cargo yard ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/zhongshan_penguins/penguins_cargo.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... where construction scraps are being packed up to be shipped back to China.
The penguins seemed oblivious to me and my camera - even running within  a few feet of me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/zhongshan_penguins/penguins_road3.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found the road again ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/zhongshan_penguins/penguins_ice1.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...only to reject this path back out onto the ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/zhongshan_penguins/penguins_ice2.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, this ice is more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/zhongshan_penguins/penguins_skua.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They hung out here for quite a while, bobbing up and down as the ice moved in the waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/zhongshan_penguins/penguins_skua3.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skuas also liked this area, and this shot captures a rare moment of peace.
It is way more common for the penguins to aggressively chase off the skuas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/zhongshan_penguins/stomachs.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've finally run out of shoreline to follow them on, and this group of 8 was last seen as specks off in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I went over the hill to the left, and found more penguins!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progress Station is less than a kilometer from Zhongshan Station, so visits between them are very common.
Since the Chinese don't celebrate New Year's Eve on Jan 1, the Russians invited everybody over for a party.&lt;/p&gt;

This means that I have been able to explore and go on more varied walks that I've had the chance to do at other stations.
(One of the bigger dangers here is crevasses, so sticking to exposed rock or well-traveled roads is required.)
I'm able to check out a radio, tell my colleague what time to expect me back, and head out for a stroll with my camera...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/zhongshan_station/masks.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/zhongshan_station/antenna_array2.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This antenna array is on the hill just above Zhongshan, and is on the way to anywhere else on the peninsula (well, you could take the road rather than the ridge ... but the road has some truly impressive puddles at this point.)
I ran into the guy whose job it is to maintain it, and found out that it is a 10.3MHz array for observing ionospheric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/zhongshan_station/progress_lake.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Progress Lake, just over an hour's leisurely walk from the station along the road between Zhongshan and the airfield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When at the airfield, we drink water from this lake and the one next to it.
It's much easier than melting snow, and it has been tested to be very clean.
(At the station, they use a reverse osmosis system.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent this field season as a member of CHINARE 32, supporting the operation of their brand-new airplane that is being used to collect geophysical data about Antarctica.
This airplane operated out of the Progress runway, which is a rugged 30-60 minute drive from the main station.
In order to make the logistics simpler, Chinare set up a camp for the fixed-wing team right next to the runway.
This was fantastically convenient - whenever the airplane was flying, the whole science team was able to live up there.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Progress Airfield&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/progress_airfield/airport.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;
We weren't the only ones using the runway - (ALCI)[http://???] operates logistics flights.
They use a ??? to fly between South Africa and Novo Station, and then use DC-3s as shown above for flights between Novo and other East Antarctic stations.
The Indian helicopter is delivering passengers who want a faster way back home than the once-yearly icebreaker =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/progress_airfield/biplane.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a very short runway nearby for this AN2 biplane - its takeoff speed is so slow that it didn't need the long one that we use.
It was delivered in the Russian icebreaker, and was being used for local geophysical surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TODO: Pic of traverse setup, then "they're off!"
The airfield was also used as the staging area for Chinare's two big traverses to Dome A and the Grove Mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;????&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TODO: Pic of debugging instruments on the airplane? Jamin behind all the racks?? (Use Jamin's pic of me?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I'm in the field, my job is to process all of the data that is being collected.
This involves both archiving the data&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and generating "quality control" products that allow us to check that the instruments are all working properly  and that the data is sufficient to address our scientific hypotheses.
We try to have all of this processing done before the next flight takes off - one of the most important parts of my job is providing this feedback to the flight operations team.
I enjoy this a lot - I get to be one of the first people to see what is underneath several kilometers of ice, and I get to spend time thinking about and coding up better ways to process and display different types of data.
Being able to work at the runway was fantastic - it gets rid of the travel-time delay before we can process the data and get feedback to the flight team about how it went; it means that if we need to debug the instruments on the airplane, we don't have to make the pilots wait around; it let the whole team work together with minimal distractions; and, as an added bonus, the food in camp was amazing&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also like to watch the plane take off and land whenever possible.
Even when I'm sleep deprived and slogging through an annoying debugging task, watching this never fails to provide a visceral reminder of how amazing it is that all these resources have been directed towards scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Red: 2 bunks (women's cabin)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Light Blue: 8 bunks (men's cabin)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dark Blue: Kitchen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yellow: Science workspace; all data processing happens here, as well as storage for all instrument spares.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dark Green: Tool shed and toilet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Light Green: 4 bunks, radio, kitchenette. Used for storage, communications, and entertainment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White: 15kW generator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinare has been doing traverses for ~15 years, and definitely knows how to set up comfortable camps.
While some of these cabins were purpose-ordered for the fixed-wing project, others were reused from a traverse.
Each of them is about 150 square feet, and are way better insulated than the tents I'm used to working in&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/progress_airfield/bedroom.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dev&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and I were usually on the night shift, so the initial plan of having us sleep in Light Green wasn't working very well.
One day Tijun surprised us by having the red cabin dragged over.
It had been unused for several years, and there was graffiti on the walls indicating that it had been used by the CCTV crew on the 2004-2005 traverse to Dome A!
After a day of cleaning, it turned into a luxuriously spacious dorm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/progress_airfield/yellow.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this cabin was originally designed as a workspace for the logistics team, but it was absolutely perfect for science.
The front room had all the computer equipment for base operations, and the back room had storage space for all of the instrument spares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/progress_airfield/jamin_vostok.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often set up shop in the back room of the yellow cabin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/progress_airfield/kitchen_office.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One night, Jamin set up an office in the kitchen.
Don't miss the satellite phone with antenna routed through the ventilation hatch!
He spent the night taking telecons and sending emails, which was made possible by Mr. Huang figuring out how to set up antennas to get access to Zhongshan Station's network all the way at the airfield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Commute&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airfield is only 20-45 minutes away from Zhongshan, depending on road conditions.
This means that we're  able to live at the station when there's bad weather, and switch to the airfield when we're flying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/progress_airfield/rugged_road.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commute is a bit rugged - when I looked at pictures from Google Earth before the season, I couldn't figure out the route. Everything looked too steep.
Turns out, they just have to have vehicles that can handle some pretty serious offroading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/progress_airfield/hilux_skua.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far the most comfortable option is this heavily-modified Hilux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/progress_airfield/hilux_stuck.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, given bad weather (by which I mean, temperatures above freezing, turning our road into deep deep slush) the truck tends to get stuck on a long hill up to the airfield.
This is not unexpected, so they stage Pisten Bully vehicles nearby in case a tow is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TODO: Image of hagglund (leaving ship, zoom in, riding in the back)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/progress_airfield/pisten_bully.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These things can go anywhere, and some of them have a box on the back for passengers.
However, it's the slowest and bumpiest mode of transport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Traverse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TODO: Move this to the Zhongshan station entry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, they're off! The 6 big CAT tractors are heading to Kunlun Station, near Dome A.

(TODO: Is it OK to mention that we reflew the traverse adn are excited about the snow surface ground truth / tying in to radar data at the drill site / comparing potential fields to seismics in GVM?

&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This data is quite literally irreplaceable, so we are paranoid about losing it. Our group has developed a process that tries to ensure that carelessness/human mistakes alone would have trouble destroying the data; malice would be required. The final step is to archive three separate copies to tape, which are then kept in different buildings so a single fire can't take them all out. When coming home, we send the tapes via different routes - they're never all on the same airplane.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've worked in tents at the McMurdo runway and the WAIS Divide field camp.

&lt;!-- Ever since we arrived at Zhongshan, I've wanted to take a walk past Progress in order to get pictures of the amazing Russian vehicles. We drive by all of these on the commute to and from the airfield, but the rough road had defeated my previous attempts to get good pictures. Thanks to a series of weather days, I finally got the chance to check them out on foot. --&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width="300" alt="""" title="""" src="/images/russian_tanks/red_penguin1.jpg"&gt;

&lt;img width="300" alt="""" title="""" src="/images/russian_tanks/blue_penguin2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- This one is still in frequent use, even if it looks like it needs some maintenance today. We routinely see it up at the airfield. It is currently parked at the top of one of the more rugged hills on our commute, a short walk from Progress. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/russian_tanks/white.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/russian_tanks/big1.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- This one is parked on top of a little hill in Progress, and is utterly massive. For scale, I sat on the bottom of the tread and had a comfortable amount of headroom.--&gt;

&lt;img width="300" alt="""" title="""" src="/images/russian_tanks/under_big1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Of course, I couldn't resist crawling around underneath - it wound up being a great spot out of the wind to make a few phone calls! --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/russian_tanks/scorpion.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- This tank was the goal of yesterday's hike - it is parked in a valley between two rugged hills a leisurely 40 minute stroll from Zhongshan. I know that it still works, because it has moved since we got here! It had been precariously perched on some melting snow, then the next day, it was parked in a puddle next to its previous pedestal. --&gt;

&lt;!-- Of course, the Russians also have a fleet of modern Pisten Bully vehicles, but they're not nearly as much fun. Below, they use one to level the airplane's parking spot after a storm. (We wind up with piles of snow under each wing - humans shovel eough snow out of the way for the plane to move, then the machinery comes in.) They're also used for grooming the skiway and pulling traverse sleds. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left the Xuelong for Zhongshan station a month ago, but we've been so busy since then it feels like much longer. I've finally gotten enough time to put together some pictures from our remarkably enjoyable and relaxing time on the boat.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We departed from Fremantle, Australia on November 22, a few days ahead of schedule. Most of the people on the Xuelong had boarded in Shanghai a few weeks earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/xuelong/pingpong.jpg" alt=""Jamin and Dr. Guo playing ping pong"" title=""Jamin and Dr. Guo playing ping pong""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ping pong table was centrally located just outside the first floor dining room. This was the leisure activity of choice on board the Xuelong, and we had the treat of watching Dr. Sun win the ship-wide tournament. Dr. Guo was kind enough to play against Jamin and I and give us pointers, and we quickly got into the habit of staying up late so we could play when everybody else was asleep. (It helped that they always served noodles or dumplings at 11pm.) The door in the background leads down to this passage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width="300" alt="""" title="""" src="/images/xuelong/passageway.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which makes it possible to get from the front (where all the bedrooms and common areas are) to the back (where the engine and helicopters are) without having to go outside into bad weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/xuelong/engine_room.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Dr. Sun and Dr. Guo gave me a tour of the engine room (I forgot my camera the first time!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width="300" alt="""" title="""" src="/images/xuelong/room.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img width="300" alt="""" title="""" src="/images/xuelong/bathroom.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised by how comfortable the ship was - three of us shared this room (I had the top left bunk), and we even had our own private bathroom, complete with shower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width="300" alt="""" title="""" src="/images/xuelong/hallway.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img width="300" alt="""" title="""" src="/images/xuelong/stairs.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consistently felt welcome and accepted on the Xuelong. I really like being in a place where everybody says "hello" or "ni hao" with a smile when passing in the hallways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/xuelong/diningroom.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent a lot of time hanging out in the second floor dining room. It was the main social gathering spot - I learned to play a popular card game (5-10-King) and Chinese Chess. At night, it was peaceful, and I really enjoyed working in a spot with natural light and views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/xuelong/dumplings.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general the food was good - our colleagues were endearingly but needlessly worried about this. I got to try some things I'd never had before, including eel and bullfrog. One of the big social events of the trip was the dumpling making party pictured above. We were eating them for days afterwards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/xuelong/view.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also spent a fair bit of time outside on the various decks, just enjoying watching the ice pass by. We were allowed to wander pretty much anywhere, and the Xuelong is big enough I never felt cabin fever. This view was nice because it was usually out of the wind, and it gave me a good look at the Xuelong. It never stopped being surreal that I was in the middle of the ocean on a Chinese icebreaker. All of the drums of fuel on the deck are meant for the airplane that we'll be using for our data collection. Our instruments are in the hold - once the fuel was removed, massive doors swung up and the cranes lifted out the shipping containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/xuelong/bridge.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the best views on the ship were from the bridge. One floor down, in the weather office, there were also great views and an open invitation to stop by for tea and snacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/xuelong/satphone.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only place the satellite phone reliably worked was on the very top deck, amidst the antennas and various science equipment, exposed to the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/xuelong/best_view.jpg" alt=""Penguins!"" title=""Penguins!""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we broke through hundreds of meters of ice and parked, this was my favorite view on the ship. The penguins loved this bit of open water, and we could almost always see a few somewhere nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/xuelong/roommates.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we were parked, we were allowed off the boat. Here I'm posing with my roommates. You can see our window - we were on the 5th floor (2 below the bridge), second from right in this view. One morning I was baffled by an almost-dead cellphone, until I discovered a text message "Welcome to China! Your roaming rates are ...". Surprise! Not only does Zhongshan station have 3G coverage, but it occasionally reached us on the Xuelong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/xuelong/paparazzi.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The penguins were entirely unfazed by the humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/xuelong/helicopter.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, they skedaddled in an adorable panic when the helicopter appeared. There was a large crack in the sea ice near the station, so the entire resupply was done by helicopter, rather than driving the ~20km over the ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/xuelong/leaving.jpg" alt="""" title=""""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, we're leaving! This was my first helicopter ride, and I was lucky enough to have a window view. Given that we were in the hold of a cargo helicopter, most people didn't.&lt;/p&gt;

Until recently, all I knew was &lt;code&gt;:q!&lt;/code&gt;, and I used it with extreme prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to not hate vim, and I still prefer emacs despite not being a power-user in the least. My problem with vim is that I really struggle with remembering which mode I am in. I think the key here is to &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; leave it in command mode unless you're actively inserting text. I should have taken the hint from how &lt;em&gt;command&lt;/em&gt; mode is also called &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; mode, but it took a while for this to click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other main thing to realize is that compands are composable, such that &lt;code&gt;:w&lt;/code&gt; is save and &lt;code&gt;:q&lt;/code&gt; is quit, so &lt;code&gt;:wq&lt;/code&gt; is save and quit. I suspect that this becomes even more powerful once you're more fluent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been silver linings for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can use the default GNU screen configuration on the robot without the usual &lt;code&gt;Ctrl-a&lt;/code&gt; headache in emacs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've fallen in love with the "delete to" command. It is exactly how I frame the operation in my head, and I've yet to find an emacs alternative that doesn't require lots of repetitive keystrokes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Links/References/Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why the heck would you use the least-accessible key on the keyboard for the most-critical key in vim? I assume that everybody remaps it: I chose CapsLock, which was a win all around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post about how &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@mkozlows/why-atom-cant-replace-vim-433852f4b4d1"&gt;vim's big idea is composability&lt;/a&gt; did a great job putting editor history into perspective for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;a href="vim-adventures.com"&gt;game&lt;/a&gt; for learning vim shortcuts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cheatsheet&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don Blankenship's research group at UTIG has been collecting geophysical data in Antarctica for decades.
Each season, we hire &lt;a href="http://www.borekair.com/"&gt;Kenn Borek Air&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-1-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-1" title=" KBA operates most of the non-military planes in Antarctica. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to operate one of their modified airplanes, stuff it full of sensors, and fly around Antarctica.
This post attempts to give a tour of the hardware involved, with an emphasis on its scientific purpose and a detour through Antarctic logistics.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;Why aerogeophysics?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/AntarcticaUSA.jpg" alt="credit: NASA" title="credit: NASA"&gt;
&lt;!--  captions fail with slashes. Argh. "credit: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/icebridge/multimedia/fall11/antarctica-US.html" %} --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antarctica is huge and hard to access.
While some types of data require in situ measurements (and are collected by overland traverses or teams dropped off by helicopter), the most efficient way to obtain basic information about the thickness of the ice and properties of the rock underneath it is to mount sensors in an airplane and start flying.
&lt;!-- Our group uses lasers to measure how quickly the ice surface elevation is changing, radar to measure its thickness, and gravity &amp; magnetics to characterize the density and type of rock underneath the ice. --&gt;
This type of mapping is inherently 1D in nature - we obtain very dense observations along a flight line, then interpolate tens of kilometers between the lines to create a map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/bedmap_distances.jpg" alt="Bedmap2 data coverage - black lines are from ice-penetrating radar. Image from Fretwell et al. 2013" title="Bedmap2 data coverage - black lines are from ice-penetrating radar. Image from Fretwell et al. 2013" width="315"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/all_UTIG_0.png" alt="UTIG radar coverage" title="UTIG radar coverage" width="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left plot above shows everwhere that BEDMAP2&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-2-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-2" title=" BEDMAP2 was an effort to integrate all the available data into maps of Antarctica's bedrock and ice thickness: Fretwell, P., Pritchard, H.

Bedmap2: improved ice bed, surface and thickness datasets for Antarctica. The Cryosphere, 7(1):375–393. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
has data.
Almost all of the black lines represent a single flight line.
The densest (apparently solid) regions of black lines correspond to grids with 5km line spacing.
The right plot shows where my research group has flown over the past few decades.
Until this season, there were places where the closest measurement was hundreds of kilometers away.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-3-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-3" title=" There may still be such places, since I haven't seen an updated map, but I was involved in a project that filled in the biggest hole. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The airplane (and logistics)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research group currently uses WWII-era DC-3s,&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-4-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-4" title=" I'll interchangeably refer to these airplanes as DC-3s and Baslers. DC-3 was the original designation; Basler is the name of a company that takes these old airplanes and entirely refurbishes them for Arctic/Antarctic work. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
like the one in the picture at the start of this post.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-5-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-5" title=" JKB, the airplane shown in many off these photos, was used in WWII. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
We've used these since 2007. All through the 1990's and early 2000's, they used a Twin Otter (below).
Conceptually, not much has changed - while we're continually upgrading the instruments, the same types of data have been being collected for over 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/sjb.jpg" alt="Twin Otter SJB; Credit: Matt Fields-Johnson" title="Twin Otter SJB; Credit: Matt Fields-Johnson" width="500"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each season is slightly different, but a common pattern is to ship everything to a larger coastal station (McMurdo or Casey), do our setup and test flights from there, then fly to another base or field camp or series of bases closer to where we want to collect data, spend anywhere from a few days to a month at each spot, then head back to the bigger station for deconfiguration and getting home.
Cargo usually travels to Antarctica on an airplane and returns on an icebreaker,&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-6-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-6" title=" The boat is obviously preferable and cheaper, but our field seasons typically begin in October or November when there's still too much sea ice for even an icebreaker to make it to the stations. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
while humans usually travel both ways in a C-17 or LC-130&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-7-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-7" title=" I thought the C-17 was uncomfortable until I got to ride in the LC-130. Get friendly with the people across from you! If you're really lucky, you might get a spot in the Australian Airbus, where you're served real food and have a whole row of seats to yourself. At least on the military planes you can visit the cockpit, but if you want a view from the cabin, you'll have to wait your turn at one of about 4 tiny windows. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
operated by the Air National Guard flying to and from Christchurch, New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may have mentioned stuffing the airplane full:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/transit_racks1-4.jpg" alt="Transit flight, rack1-3" title="Transit flight, rack1-3" width="340"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/rack4_pcl.jpg" alt="Transit flight, rack 4 and PCL" title="Transit flight, rack 4 and PCL" width="340"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above images are from transit flights, when we had way more people and baggage than for normal survey operations.
The right photo was taken looking from the center of the plane towards the back.
In it, we can see part of rack 4 (used for HF radar electronics), the photon counting lidar with its control laptop&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-8-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-8" title=" Sadly, it would appear that this temperamental instrument is only collecting noise in this image. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
on top, and the curtain that separates the heated part of the plane from the cargo doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a similar location but looking forward (and taken on a non-transit flight!) we get a nice look at the racks in the front half of the airplane:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/racks1-3.jpg" alt="racks 1-3, looking forwards"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting at the cockpit, we have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rack 1 - operator interface, VHF amplifier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rack 2 - VHF radar electronics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;black box - gravimeter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rack 3 - gravimeter electronics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes an absolute minimum of 2 days to install all of this, several more for test flights to make sure everything works, and a very full day at the end of the season to strip it all out and start packing to go home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/kevin_and_john.jpg" alt="Kevin and John, our pilots last season" title="Kevin and John, our pilots last season"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any Kenn Borek airplane comes with 3 people dedicated to its operation: a mechanic (who is usually waiting back at the station), a pilot, and a copilot.
Here are Kevin (left) and John (right), our pilots last season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/refueling_dmc.jpg" alt="Refueling at Dome C" title="Refueling at Dome C"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find that the DC-3 has the best tradeoff for fuel burned per line-km of data collected.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-9-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-9" title="     In addition to the DC-3s and Twin Otters, other groups have used LC-130s and P-3s to collect radar sounding data.

Last season, at WAIS divide, the United States Antarctic Program used LC-130s to bring us fuel. They burn 3000 pounds of fuel an hour, and each delivery run from McMurdo provides enough fuel for ~3 of our survey flights.     " class="simple-footnote"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
travels at a nominal cruising speed of 160 knots, and has an endurance of ~6.5 hours in survey configuration.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-12-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-12" title="     Endurance is primarily a function of how much fuel can be carried. The upper limit is neither the volume of the tanks nor the maximum weight that can get airborne - it's the maximum weight that the airplane can safely land with, if an emergency landing were required just after takeoff. Nobody is going to be happy if you dump fuel over Antarctica. This means that each additional passenger costs ~15 minutes of extremely expensive survey time, and has been known to be a factor in deciding which additional instruments to install. Do you want the full suite of available instruments, or do you want an additional 30 minutes of survey time in order to reach that geologically interesting hole in the map?     " class="simple-footnote"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
So, for every day of good weather, we can get up to 2000 line-km of data.
If the weather has been bad and the pilots have extra hours available, we might do two 5-hour flights rather than a single 6.5 hour one, but that's the maximum for a single flight crew.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-13-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-13" title="     Pilots have legally- and contractually-mandated maximum duty day lengths, days off, maximum hours in the air per day, and rolling weekly/monthly flight hour maximums.     " class="simple-footnote"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/flying_weather.jpg" alt="not flying weather" title="not flying weather"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antarctic weather is usually the biggest challenge to successfully flying all of the survey lines that we've planned.
At a rough estimate, we're only able to fly 1/2 of the days when the airplane is available.
The biggest worry here is the ability to land.
When you're using snow for a runway, it doesn't take much in the way of clouds or fog to ruin all contrast.
Add a few more clouds or some snow falling from the sky as in the picture above, and it can be hard to find the horizon when you're just walking around.
Clouds are also a problem because of the potential for the wings - or worse, the radar antennas - to ice up.
Where we were operating last season, there were no good alternative runways, which meant that we were only able to fly when the weather was forecast to be pristine for the next ~8 hours.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-14-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-14" title=" This was … tough. The field camp was at an ice divide, meaning that weather systems could blow in from any of three directions, with very hard-to-predict timing. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have everything installed and are airborne, what data are we collecting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;VHF Radar&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/installing_antenna.jpg" alt="Installing VHF antennas on MKB" title="Installing VHF antennas on MKB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most visible external modifications that we make to the airplane are the antennas installed under each wing for the VHF radar.
While the receiver electronics have changed multiple times since then, these antennas are the same ones that were used back in the 1970's for some of the first ice-penetrating radar surveys of Antarctica.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-15-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-15" title=" That was before GPS, so the positioning was only good to ~5km, and the radar data was recorded photographically, not digitally! The technology didn't exist to digitize the received signals and write them to disk like we do now. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Both antennas are used for transmitting the 8kW signal and for receiving the much weaker echoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/ASB.JKB1a.R10Wa_full.png" alt="" example="" asb.jkb1a.r10wa""="" transect:="" title=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use this 60MHz radar to get a 2D cross-section of the ice.
An example of the data is shown above - you can clearly see the ice surface, layers within the ice, and mountains underneath.
I've previously talked about &lt;a href="/blog/2015/07/27/a-brief-introduction-to-ice-penetrating-radar/"&gt;interpreting the radargrams&lt;/a&gt;, so I won't go further into it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most basic science done with data from this sensor is determining the topography underneath kilometers of ice.
Among other things, this is important for calculating how much potential sea level change is locked up in Antarctica, and how stable the ice sheet is likely to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/Fretwell2013BedmapImage.png" alt="Bedmap2 image from Fretwell et al. 2013" title="Bedmap2 image from Fretwell et al. 2013" width="610"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This type of data has also been used to infer that East Antarctica has dramatically fluctuated in size in the past.[ref]
Young, D. A., Wright, A. P., Roberts, J. L., Warner, R. C., Young, N. W., Greenbaum, J. S., Schroeder, D. M., Holt, J. W., Sugden, D. E., Blankenship, D. D., and Others (2011). A dynamic early East Antarctic Ice Sheet suggested by ice-covered fjord landscapes. Nature, 474(7349):72–75.
[/ref]
This fluctuation is particularly interesting because East Antarctica contains the majority of the ice in Antarctica,[ref]
According to Fretwell2013, EAIS contains 53.3m of sea level rise, of which 19.2 is ice grounded below sea level. WAIS has 4.3 total, of which 3.4 is grounded below sea level.
[/ref] and had been thought to be more stable than West Antarctica.
The left image above shows the topography in the Aurora Subglacial Basin, and the set of differently-oriented U-shaped valleys was taken as evidence of different ice sheet configurations, with different ice flow directions and coastline configurations.
The hypothesized coastlines are shown in the image above right.

--&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;HF radar&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the 60MHz VHF radar, we also field a 2MHz HF radar.
Rather than antennas under the wings, we unspool a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sim\)&lt;/span&gt;60m long wire antenna through a port in the floor.
My attempts to get a clear picture of this antenna deployed while in flight have failed, so the best I have is one of Jamin preparing to reel the antenna back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/hf_interior.jpg" the="" jsg="" title="" of="" pic="" in""="" alt="" reeling="" antenna=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main factors determining how deep of a bed we can detect is the radar signal's attenuation as it passes through the ice.
Both warmer ice and saltier ice lead to higher losses, as does a rough surface that causes scattering.
In some conditions, energy at 2MHz penetrates better than energy at 60MHz, at the cost of poorer vertical resultion due to the much longer wavelength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We primarily fly this dual-frequency setup as a testbed for the REASON instrument that will be on the next mission to Europa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Gravity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm continually amazed that we're able to measure accelarations accurately enough to infer underwater topography based on local changes in gravitational acceleration.
Stationary instruments on the ground can measure to a precision of ~5uGal.
For context, the gravity field changes by ~300uGal/m as you get farther from the center of the earth, and 1G = 9.8m/s2 = 980Gal.
From a moving platform with turbulance, we'll get precision on the order of a few mGal.
This requires integrating many measurements in order to get a usable signal to noise ratio, which means that we're only able to detect features on the scale of ~5km.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-19-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-19" title=" For a fixed sampling rate, the slower you fly the better your data will be. We're excited about the potential for mounting gravimeters on helicopters to get even higher-resolution data! Lower is also better, because you're closer to the source. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
The main complication when interpreting gravity data is that you're actually measuring differences in density.
If you assume less-dense sedimentary rocks underneath the water, you're going to wind up balancing them out with a shallower water column, while if you assume denser rocks, you'll infer deeper water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamin Greenbaum recently published a paper&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-20-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-20" title=" Greenbaum, J. S., Blankenship, D. D., Young, D. A., Richter, T. G., Aitken, A. R. A., Legresy, B., Schroeder, D. M., Roberts, J. L., Warner, R. C., van Ommen, T. D., and Siegert, M. J. (2015). Increased Ocean Access to Totten Glacier, East Antarctica. Nature Geos. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
improving the estimates of the cavity shape underneath the Totten Ice Shelf.
His inferred geometry is shown below on the left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/Greenbaum2015.jpg" alt="Totten bathymetry from Greenbaum et al. 2015" title="Totten bathymetry from Greenbaum et al. 2015"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an important result because he showed that the ocean is deep enough that warm deep water is able to enter the cavity, which could explain why the glacier's surface is lowering so quickly.
It was also a significant improvement over the previous bathymetry - in the figure above right, you can see the old best-guess bathymetry as a dashed line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Magnetics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/mag_boom.jpg" alt="Magnetometer boom" title="Magnetometer boom, getting that instrument as far away as possible from all the metal on the plane!"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have two magnetometers on the plane.
One is mounted inside near the cameras and and measures the 3 dimensional magnetic field vector.
A much more precise one measuring only the magnitude is stuck way at the end of the tail boom, shown above.
The idea behind this arrangement is that we want to understand how the airplane's orientation and interaction with the earth's magnetic field affects the measured field (you can see turns very clearly in the interior data), but we want the most accurate reading possible, taken as far away as possible from all the metal in the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/base_mag.jpg" alt="basemag" title="Magnetometer setup back at camp" width="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also record the magnetic field at a base station.
The above image shows the magnetometer housing and its solar charger.
Data from this is used to determine when to fly (it gets noisier at certain times of day) and then compared with the in-flight data to determine an anomaly.
Any signal that's different between the base and the airplane can be assumed to be from local topography, not the earth's temporally varying magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Igneous rocks tend to be magnetic, with their internal field aligned with what the earth's field was when the rock formed, while ice and sedimentary rocks are not magnetic.
This means that we can figure out what type of rocks are underneath the ice based on the magnetic signal that we observe!
This process has been used to infer the presence of shallow volcanoes underneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.
This matches very well with other observations indicating that the ice sheet is warmer and melting more than you'd expect for somewhere with globally average geothermal flux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determining the depth of the magnetic rocks can also be useful for interpreting gravity data.
If something's magnetic, you know that it's denser than sediments would be, and anything that helps you constrain the density model will improve the gravity inversion.
Depth can be inferred from the signal's gradient - the deeper a feature is, the smoother the resulting signal will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cameras&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/cam_las_windows.jpg" alt="Image of bottom of airplane, with las and cam labeled. If can see it, also label where HF antenna comes out" title="Image of bottom of airplane, with las and cam labeled. If can see it, also label where HF antenna comes out"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't use camera data directly to answer any science questions,&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-21-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-21" title=" We have recently learned that whale biologists are seriously interested in our data any time we fly over open water (which we do with some frequency for gravity data). It turns out that they've been fielding airplanes just to get the same type of imagery that we collect as a routine part of our operations. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but the pictures are useful for providing context for other data.
This has included trying to figure out why we were missing laser data: Was it cloudy out? Were we in a heavily crevassed region? Were we over water?
It has also been used to validate radar-derived surface roughness estimates.
The below figure is from a paper by Cyril Grima&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-22-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-22" title=" Grima, C., Schroeder, D. M., Blankenship, D. D., and Young, D. A. (2014a). Planetary landing-zone reconnaissance using ice-penetrating radar data: Concept validation in Antarctica. Planetary and Space Science. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
and shows roughness parameters derived from a statistical examination of the returned radar pulse shape.
The extracted parameters show an excellent qualitative agreement with the imagery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/Grima2014_roughness1.jpg" alt="Qualitative validation of surface roughness from Grima et al. 2014" title="Qualitative validation of surface roughness from Grima et al. 2014" width="340"&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Laser altimetry&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use lasers to very accurately measure the surface elevation of the ice sheet.
Even where it is changing most rapidly, these changes are measured in meters per year, and our goal is to be able to detect changes of 5cm per year.
From 2003-2009, ICESat collected laser altimetry from space, leading to a detailed map of where elevations are changing across Antarctica and Greenland.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-23-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-23" title=" Pritchard, H. D., Arthern, R. J., Vaughan, D. G., and Edwards, L. A. (2009). Extensive dynamic thinning on the margins of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Nature, 461(7266):971– 975. /ref." class="simple-footnote"&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/Pritchard2009.jpg" alt="ICESat elevation changes, Pritchard et al. 2009" title="ICESat elevation changes, Pritchard et al. 2009"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, ICESat failed in 2009, and its replacement has not yet been launched.
So, a number of groups (including ours) have been reflying ICESat tracks in an effort to extend the temporal record and hopefully connect it to ICESat II.
Our system, ALAMO&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-24-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-24" title=" Young, D. A., Lindzey, L. E., Blankenship, D. D., Greenbaum, J.

Land-ice elevation changes from photon counting swath altimetry: First applications over the Antarctic ice sheet. Journal of Glaciology. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, includes an off-the-shelf single-beam Riegl altimeter, which is well characterized and used to determine the range to the surface.
We also have a more temperamental scanning photon counting lidar that is a protopype of what will be on ICESat II.
Its data points are dense enough to map individual buildings in McMurdo (below), but we mostly use its data to determine the ice's surface slope, which is important when trying to compare two slightly offset repeat flights of the same line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/mcm_411_375.png" alt="PCL data from Flying over McMurdo" title="PCL data from Flying over McMurdo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;GPS, IMU&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have 4 GPS antennas mounted outside the plane: at the center, the tail, and on each wing.
These are used to get absolute position in space.
The IMUs measure accelations, and give us a very accurate orientation estimate - we have a little MEMs one mounted on rack 2, and a more precise one mounted directly to the PCL.
After post-processing, we typically know our position to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sim\)&lt;/span&gt;2cm and our orientation to milli-radian accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we don't use this as science data in and of itself, knowing the airplane's exact position is absolutely crucial for processing the other data.
For example, the laser altimetry measurements are basically a 600m lever arm, and if we want to know the position of the end of that arm to centimeter accuracy, orientation matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Outside Air Temperature, Pressure&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more metadata for our operation than science data.
 No major publications result from this, but I did use them to validate a correction for the speed of light in air, which primarily depends on pressure and temperature.
I was utterly dumbfounded when I realized that the difference in conditions between the coast and inland domes could result in a 10cm bias in the altimetry data!
We don't consistently collect temperature and pressure data, but we always know our altitude.
So, I needed to check that an altitude-based approximation to the speed of light would remove any geographical bias in our data.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-25-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-25" title=" I was impressed by my research group's data management discipline when I was able to dig up and painlessly use 20+ year old data to do this analysis!

JKB, the airplane shown in many off these photos, was used in WWII.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-5-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-6"&gt;
The boat is obviously preferable and cheaper, but our field seasons typically begin in October or November when there's still too much sea ice for even an icebreaker to make it to the stations.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-6-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-7"&gt;
I thought the C-17 was uncomfortable until I got to ride in the LC-130. Get friendly with the people across from you! If you're really lucky, you might get a spot in the Australian Airbus, where you're served real food and have a whole row of seats to yourself. At least on the military planes you can visit the cockpit, but if you want a view from the cabin, you'll have to wait your turn at one of about 4 tiny windows.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-7-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-8"&gt;
Sadly, it would appear that this temperamental instrument is only collecting noise in this image.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-8-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-9"&gt;
    In addition to the DC-3s and Twin Otters, other groups have used LC-130s and P-3s to collect radar sounding data.
They're bigger, fly faster, and burn more fuel.
     &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-9-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-10"&gt;
This varies dramatically with elevation; we get significantly better than this flying over the Antarctic Plateau, and worse around the coast.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-10-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-11"&gt;
    If you're at a coastal station, fuel is brought in on an ice breaker, and is less of a constraint.
If you're inland, that fuel is either brought in via a traverse (huge logistical operation) or flown in on LC-130s.
Last season, at WAIS divide, the United States Antarctic Program used LC-130s to bring us fuel.
They burn 3000 pounds of fuel an hour, and each delivery run from McMurdo provides enough fuel for ~3 of our survey flights.
     &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-11-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-12"&gt;
    Endurance is primarily a function of how much fuel can be carried.
The upper limit is neither the volume of the tanks nor the maximum weight that can get airborne - it's the maximum weight that the airplane can safely land with, if an emergency landing were required just after takeoff.
Nobody is going to be happy if you dump fuel over Antarctica.
This means that each additional passenger costs ~15 minutes of extremely expensive survey time, and has been known to be a factor in deciding which additional instruments to install.
Do you want the full suite of available instruments, or do you want an additional 30 minutes of survey time in order to reach that geologically interesting hole in the map?
     &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-12-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-13"&gt;
    Pilots have legally- and contractually-mandated maximum duty day lengths, days off, maximum hours in the air per day, and rolling weekly/monthly flight hour maximums.
     &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-13-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-14"&gt;
This was … tough.
The field camp was at an ice divide, meaning that weather systems could blow in from any of three directions, with very hard-to-predict timing.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-14-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-15"&gt;
That was before GPS, so the positioning was only good to ~5km, and the radar data was recorded photographically, not digitally! The technology didn't exist to digitize the received signals and write them to disk like we do now.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-15-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-16"&gt;

NASA has produced some very fun visualizations of the improvement bewteen BEDMAP and BEDMAP2, as well as the ice surface / bed topography.

For a fixed sampling rate, the slower you fly the better your data will be. We're excited about the potential for mounting gravimeters on helicopters to get even higher-resolution data! Lower is also better, because you're closer to the source.

&lt;p&gt;Don Blankenship's research group at UTIG has been collecting geophysical data in Antarctica for decades.
Each season, we hire &lt;a href="http://www.borekair.com/"&gt;Kenn Borek Air&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-1-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-1" title=" KBA operates most of the non-military planes in Antarctica. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to operate one of their modified airplanes, stuff it full of sensors, and fly around Antarctica.
This post attempts to give a tour of the hardware involved, with an emphasis on its scientific purpose and a detour through Antarctic logistics.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;Why aerogeophysics?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/AntarcticaUSA.jpg" alt="credit: NASA" title="credit: NASA"&gt;
&lt;!--  captions fail with slashes. Argh. "credit: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/icebridge/multimedia/fall11/antarctica-US.html" %} --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antarctica is huge and hard to access.
While some types of data require in situ measurements (and are collected by overland traverses or teams dropped off by helicopter), the most efficient way to obtain basic information about the thickness of the ice and properties of the rock underneath it is to mount sensors in an airplane and start flying.
&lt;!-- Our group uses lasers to measure how quickly the ice surface elevation is changing, radar to measure its thickness, and gravity &amp; magnetics to characterize the density and type of rock underneath the ice. --&gt;
This type of mapping is inherently 1D in nature - we obtain very dense observations along a flight line, then interpolate tens of kilometers between the lines to create a map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/bedmap_distances.jpg" alt="Bedmap2 data coverage - black lines are from ice-penetrating radar. Image from Fretwell et al. 2013" title="Bedmap2 data coverage - black lines are from ice-penetrating radar. Image from Fretwell et al. 2013" width="315"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/all_UTIG_0.png" alt="UTIG radar coverage" title="UTIG radar coverage" width="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left plot above shows everwhere that BEDMAP2&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-2-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-2" title=" BEDMAP2 was an effort to integrate all the available data into maps of Antarctica's bedrock and ice thickness: Fretwell, P., Pritchard, H.

Bedmap2: improved ice bed, surface and thickness datasets for Antarctica. The Cryosphere, 7(1):375–393. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
has data.
Almost all of the black lines represent a single flight line.
The densest (apparently solid) regions of black lines correspond to grids with 5km line spacing.
The right plot shows where my research group has flown over the past few decades.
Until this season, there were places where the closest measurement was hundreds of kilometers away.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-3-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-3" title=" There may still be such places, since I haven't seen an updated map, but I was involved in a project that filled in the biggest hole. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The airplane (and logistics)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research group currently uses WWII-era DC-3s,&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-4-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-4" title=" I'll interchangeably refer to these airplanes as DC-3s and Baslers. DC-3 was the original designation; Basler is the name of a company that takes these old airplanes and entirely refurbishes them for Arctic/Antarctic work. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
like the one in the picture at the start of this post.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-5-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-5" title=" JKB, the airplane shown in many off these photos, was used in WWII. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
We've used these since 2007. All through the 1990's and early 2000's, they used a Twin Otter (below).
Conceptually, not much has changed - while we're continually upgrading the instruments, the same types of data have been being collected for over 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/sjb.jpg" alt="Twin Otter SJB; Credit: Matt Fields-Johnson" title="Twin Otter SJB; Credit: Matt Fields-Johnson" width="500"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each season is slightly different, but a common pattern is to ship everything to a larger coastal station (McMurdo or Casey), do our setup and test flights from there, then fly to another base or field camp or series of bases closer to where we want to collect data, spend anywhere from a few days to a month at each spot, then head back to the bigger station for deconfiguration and getting home.
Cargo usually travels to Antarctica on an airplane and returns on an icebreaker,&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-6-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-6" title=" The boat is obviously preferable and cheaper, but our field seasons typically begin in October or November when there's still too much sea ice for even an icebreaker to make it to the stations. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
while humans usually travel both ways in a C-17 or LC-130&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-7-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-7" title=" I thought the C-17 was uncomfortable until I got to ride in the LC-130.

" class="simple-footnote"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
operated by the Air National Guard flying to and from Christchurch, New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may have mentioned stuffing the airplane full:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/transit_racks1-4.jpg" alt="Transit flight, rack1-3" title="Transit flight, rack1-3" width="340"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/rack4_pcl.jpg" alt="Transit flight, rack 4 and PCL" title="Transit flight, rack 4 and PCL" width="340"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above images are from transit flights, when we had way more people and baggage than for normal survey operations.
The right photo was taken looking from the center of the plane towards the back.
In it, we can see part of rack 4 (used for HF radar electronics), the photon counting lidar with its control laptop&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-8-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-8" title=" Sadly, it would appear that this temperamental instrument is only collecting noise in this image. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
on top, and the curtain that separates the heated part of the plane from the cargo doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a similar location but looking forward (and taken on a non-transit flight!) we get a nice look at the racks in the front half of the airplane:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/racks1-3.jpg" alt="racks 1-3, looking forwards"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting at the cockpit, we have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rack 1 - operator interface, VHF amplifier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rack 2 - VHF radar electronics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;black box - gravimeter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rack 3 - gravimeter electronics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes an absolute minimum of 2 days to install all of this, several more for test flights to make sure everything works, and a very full day at the end of the season to strip it all out and start packing to go home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/kevin_and_john.jpg" alt="Kevin and John, our pilots last season" title="Kevin and John, our pilots last season"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any Kenn Borek airplane comes with 3 people dedicated to its operation: a mechanic (who is usually waiting back at the station), a pilot, and a copilot.
Here are Kevin (left) and John (right), our pilots last season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/refueling_dmc.jpg" alt="Refueling at Dome C" title="Refueling at Dome C"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find that the DC-3 has the best tradeoff for fuel burned per line-km of data collected.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-9-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-9" title="     In addition to the DC-3s and Twin Otters, other groups have used LC-130s and P-3s to collect radar sounding data. They're bigger, fly faster, and burn more fuel.     " class="simple-footnote"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
This airplane burns ~1000&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-10-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-10" title=" This varies dramatically with elevation; we get significantly better than this flying over the Antarctic Plateau, and worse around the coast. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
pounds per hour,&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-11-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-11" title="     If you're at a coastal station, fuel is brought in on an ice breaker, and is less of a constraint.

travels at a nominal cruising speed of 160 knots, and has an endurance of ~6.5 hours in survey configuration.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-12-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-12" title="     Endurance is primarily a function of how much fuel can be carried.

" class="simple-footnote"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
So, for every day of good weather, we can get up to 2000 line-km of data.
If the weather has been bad and the pilots have extra hours available, we might do two 5-hour flights rather than a single 6.5 hour one, but that's the maximum for a single flight crew.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-13-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-13" title="     Pilots have legally- and contractually-mandated maximum duty day lengths, days off, maximum hours in the air per day, and rolling weekly/monthly flight hour maximums.     " class="simple-footnote"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/flying_weather.jpg" alt="not flying weather" title="not flying weather"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antarctic weather is usually the biggest challenge to successfully flying all of the survey lines that we've planned.
At a rough estimate, we're only able to fly 1/2 of the days when the airplane is available.
The biggest worry here is the ability to land.
When you're using snow for a runway, it doesn't take much in the way of clouds or fog to ruin all contrast.
Add a few more clouds or some snow falling from the sky as in the picture above, and it can be hard to find the horizon when you're just walking around.
Clouds are also a problem because of the potential for the wings - or worse, the radar antennas - to ice up.
Where we were operating last season, there were no good alternative runways, which meant that we were only able to fly when the weather was forecast to be pristine for the next ~8 hours.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-14-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-14" title=" This was … tough. The field camp was at an ice divide, meaning that weather systems could blow in from any of three directions, with very hard-to-predict timing. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have everything installed and are airborne, what data are we collecting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;VHF Radar&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/installing_antenna.jpg" alt="Installing VHF antennas on MKB" title="Installing VHF antennas on MKB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most visible external modifications that we make to the airplane are the antennas installed under each wing for the VHF radar.
While the receiver electronics have changed multiple times since then, these antennas are the same ones that were used back in the 1970's for some of the first ice-penetrating radar surveys of Antarctica.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-15-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-15" title=" That was before GPS, so the positioning was only good to ~5km, and the radar data was recorded photographically, not digitally! The technology didn't exist to digitize the received signals and write them to disk like we do now. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Both antennas are used for transmitting the 8kW signal and for receiving the much weaker echoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/ASB.JKB1a.R10Wa_full.png" alt="" example="" asb.jkb1a.r10wa""="" transect:="" title=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use this 60MHz radar to get a 2D cross-section of the ice.
An example of the data is shown above - you can clearly see the ice surface, layers within the ice, and mountains underneath.
I've previously talked about &lt;a href="/blog/2015/07/27/a-brief-introduction-to-ice-penetrating-radar/"&gt;interpreting the radargrams&lt;/a&gt;, so I won't go further into it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most basic science done with data from this sensor is determining the topography underneath kilometers of ice.
Among other things, this is important for calculating how much potential sea level change is locked up in Antarctica, and how stable the ice sheet is likely to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/Fretwell2013BedmapImage.png" alt="Bedmap2 image from Fretwell et al. 2013" title="Bedmap2 image from Fretwell et al. 2013" width="610"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This type of data has also been used to infer that East Antarctica has dramatically fluctuated in size in the past.[ref]
Young, D. A., Wright, A. P., Roberts, J. L., Warner, R. C., Young, N. W., Greenbaum, J. S., Schroeder, D. M., Holt, J. W., Sugden, D. E., Blankenship, D. D., and Others (2011). A dynamic early East Antarctic Ice Sheet suggested by ice-covered fjord landscapes. Nature, 474(7349):72–75.
[/ref]
This fluctuation is particularly interesting because East Antarctica contains the majority of the ice in Antarctica,[ref]
According to Fretwell2013, EAIS contains 53.3m of sea level rise, of which 19.2 is ice grounded below sea level. WAIS has 4.3 total, of which 3.4 is grounded below sea level.
[/ref] and had been thought to be more stable than West Antarctica.
The left image above shows the topography in the Aurora Subglacial Basin, and the set of differently-oriented U-shaped valleys was taken as evidence of different ice sheet configurations, with different ice flow directions and coastline configurations.
The hypothesized coastlines are shown in the image above right.

&lt;h4&gt;HF radar&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the 60MHz VHF radar, we also field a 2MHz HF radar.
Rather than antennas under the wings, we unspool a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sim\)&lt;/span&gt;60m long wire antenna through a port in the floor.
My attempts to get a clear picture of this antenna deployed while in flight have failed, so the best I have is one of Jamin preparing to reel the antenna back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/hf_interior.jpg" the="" jsg="" title="" of="" pic="" in""="" alt="" reeling="" antenna=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main factors determining how deep of a bed we can detect is the radar signal's attenuation as it passes through the ice.
Both warmer ice and saltier ice lead to higher losses, as does a rough surface that causes scattering.
In some conditions, energy at 2MHz penetrates better than energy at 60MHz, at the cost of poorer vertical resultion due to the much longer wavelength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We primarily fly this dual-frequency setup as a testbed for the REASON instrument that will be on the next mission to Europa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Gravity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm continually amazed that we're able to measure accelarations accurately enough to infer underwater topography based on local changes in gravitational acceleration.
Stationary instruments on the ground can measure to a precision of ~5uGal.
For context, the gravity field changes by ~300uGal/m as you get farther from the center of the earth, and 1G = 9.8m/s2 = 980Gal.
From a moving platform with turbulance, we'll get precision on the order of a few mGal.
This requires integrating many measurements in order to get a usable signal to noise ratio, which means that we're only able to detect features on the scale of ~5km.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-19-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-19" title=" For a fixed sampling rate, the slower you fly the better your data will be. We're excited about the potential for mounting gravimeters on helicopters to get even higher-resolution data! Lower is also better, because you're closer to the source. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
The main complication when interpreting gravity data is that you're actually measuring differences in density.
If you assume less-dense sedimentary rocks underneath the water, you're going to wind up balancing them out with a shallower water column, while if you assume denser rocks, you'll infer deeper water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamin Greenbaum recently published a paper&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-20-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-20" title=" Greenbaum, J. S., Blankenship, D. D., Young, D. A., Richter, T. G., Aitken, A. R. A., Legresy, B., Schroeder, D. M., Roberts, J. L., Warner, R. C., van Ommen, T. D., and Siegert, M. J. (2015). Increased Ocean Access to Totten Glacier, East Antarctica. Nature Geos. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
improving the estimates of the cavity shape underneath the Totten Ice Shelf.
His inferred geometry is shown below on the left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/Greenbaum2015.jpg" alt="Totten bathymetry from Greenbaum et al. 2015" title="Totten bathymetry from Greenbaum et al. 2015"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an important result because he showed that the ocean is deep enough that warm deep water is able to enter the cavity, which could explain why the glacier's surface is lowering so quickly.
It was also a significant improvement over the previous bathymetry - in the figure above right, you can see the old best-guess bathymetry as a dashed line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Magnetics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/mag_boom.jpg" alt="Magnetometer boom" title="Magnetometer boom, getting that instrument as far away as possible from all the metal on the plane!"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have two magnetometers on the plane.
One is mounted inside near the cameras and and measures the 3 dimensional magnetic field vector.
A much more precise one measuring only the magnitude is stuck way at the end of the tail boom, shown above.
The idea behind this arrangement is that we want to understand how the airplane's orientation and interaction with the earth's magnetic field affects the measured field (you can see turns very clearly in the interior data), but we want the most accurate reading possible, taken as far away as possible from all the metal in the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/base_mag.jpg" alt="basemag" title="Magnetometer setup back at camp" width="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also record the magnetic field at a base station.
The above image shows the magnetometer housing and its solar charger.
Data from this is used to determine when to fly (it gets noisier at certain times of day) and then compared with the in-flight data to determine an anomaly.
Any signal that's different between the base and the airplane can be assumed to be from local topography, not the earth's temporally varying magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Igneous rocks tend to be magnetic, with their internal field aligned with what the earth's field was when the rock formed, while ice and sedimentary rocks are not magnetic.
This means that we can figure out what type of rocks are underneath the ice based on the magnetic signal that we observe!
This process has been used to infer the presence of shallow volcanoes underneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.
This matches very well with other observations indicating that the ice sheet is warmer and melting more than you'd expect for somewhere with globally average geothermal flux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determining the depth of the magnetic rocks can also be useful for interpreting gravity data.
If something's magnetic, you know that it's denser than sediments would be, and anything that helps you constrain the density model will improve the gravity inversion.
Depth can be inferred from the signal's gradient - the deeper a feature is, the smoother the resulting signal will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cameras&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/cam_las_windows.jpg" alt="Image of bottom of airplane, with las and cam labeled. If can see it, also label where HF antenna comes out" title="Image of bottom of airplane, with las and cam labeled. If can see it, also label where HF antenna comes out"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't use camera data directly to answer any science questions,&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-21-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-21" title=" We have recently learned that whale biologists are seriously interested in our data any time we fly over open water (which we do with some frequency for gravity data). It turns out that they've been fielding airplanes just to get the same type of imagery that we collect as a routine part of our operations. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but the pictures are useful for providing context for other data.
This has included trying to figure out why we were missing laser data: Was it cloudy out? Were we in a heavily crevassed region? Were we over water?
It has also been used to validate radar-derived surface roughness estimates.
The below figure is from a paper by Cyril Grima&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-22-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-22" title=" Grima, C., Schroeder, D. M., Blankenship, D. D., and Young, D. A. (2014a). Planetary landing-zone reconnaissance using ice-penetrating radar data: Concept validation in Antarctica. Planetary and Space Science. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
and shows roughness parameters derived from a statistical examination of the returned radar pulse shape.
The extracted parameters show an excellent qualitative agreement with the imagery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/Grima2014_roughness1.jpg" alt="Qualitative validation of surface roughness from Grima et al. 2014" title="Qualitative validation of surface roughness from Grima et al. 2014" width="340"&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Laser altimetry&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use lasers to very accurately measure the surface elevation of the ice sheet.
Even where it is changing most rapidly, these changes are measured in meters per year, and our goal is to be able to detect changes of 5cm per year.
From 2003-2009, ICESat collected laser altimetry from space, leading to a detailed map of where elevations are changing across Antarctica and Greenland.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-23-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-23" title=" Pritchard, H. D., Arthern, R. J., Vaughan, D. G., and Edwards, L. A. (2009). Extensive dynamic thinning on the margins of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Nature, 461(7266):971– 975. /ref." class="simple-footnote"&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/Pritchard2009.jpg" alt="ICESat elevation changes, Pritchard et al. 2009" title="ICESat elevation changes, Pritchard et al. 2009"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, ICESat failed in 2009, and its replacement has not yet been launched.
So, a number of groups (including ours) have been reflying ICESat tracks in an effort to extend the temporal record and hopefully connect it to ICESat II.
Our system, ALAMO&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-24-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-24" title=" Young, D. A., Lindzey, L. E., Blankenship, D. D., Greenbaum, J.

Land-ice elevation changes from photon counting swath altimetry: First applications over the Antarctic ice sheet. Journal of Glaciology. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, includes an off-the-shelf single-beam Riegl altimeter, which is well characterized and used to determine the range to the surface.
We also have a more temperamental scanning photon counting lidar that is a protopype of what will be on ICESat II.
Its data points are dense enough to map individual buildings in McMurdo (below), but we mostly use its data to determine the ice's surface slope, which is important when trying to compare two slightly offset repeat flights of the same line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/platform_tour/mcm_411_375.png" alt="PCL data from Flying over McMurdo" title="PCL data from Flying over McMurdo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;GPS, IMU&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have 4 GPS antennas mounted outside the plane: at the center, the tail, and on each wing.
These are used to get absolute position in space.
The IMUs measure accelations, and give us a very accurate orientation estimate - we have a little MEMs one mounted on rack 2, and a more precise one mounted directly to the PCL.
After post-processing, we typically know our position to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sim\)&lt;/span&gt;2cm and our orientation to milli-radian accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we don't use this as science data in and of itself, knowing the airplane's exact position is absolutely crucial for processing the other data.
For example, the laser altimetry measurements are basically a 600m lever arm, and if we want to know the position of the end of that arm to centimeter accuracy, orientation matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Outside Air Temperature, Pressure&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more metadata for our operation than science data.
 No major publications result from this, but I did use them to validate a correction for the speed of light in air, which primarily depends on pressure and temperature.
I was utterly dumbfounded when I realized that the difference in conditions between the coast and inland domes could result in a 10cm bias in the altimetry data!
We don't consistently collect temperature and pressure data, but we always know our altitude.
So, I needed to check that an altitude-based approximation to the speed of light would remove any geographical bias in our data.&lt;sup id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-25-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-25" title=" I was impressed by my research group's data management discipline when I was able to dig up and painlessly use 20+ year old data to do this analysis!

I'll interchangeably refer to these airplanes as DC-3s and Baslers.
DC-3 was the original designation; Basler is the name of a company that takes these old airplanes and entirely refurbishes them for Arctic/Antarctic work.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-4-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-5"&gt;
JKB, the airplane shown in many off these photos, was used in WWII.

The boat is obviously preferable and cheaper, but our field seasons typically begin in October or November when there's still too much sea ice for even an icebreaker to make it to the stations.

I thought the C-17 was uncomfortable until I got to ride in the LC-130. Get friendly with the people across from you! If you're really lucky, you might get a spot in the Australian Airbus, where you're served real food and have a whole row of seats to yourself. At least on the military planes you can visit the cockpit, but if you want a view from the cabin, you'll have to wait your turn at one of about 4 tiny windows.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-7-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-8"&gt;
Sadly, it would appear that this temperamental instrument is only collecting noise in this image.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-8-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-9"&gt;
    In addition to the DC-3s and Twin Otters, other groups have used LC-130s and P-3s to collect radar sounding data.
They're bigger, fly faster, and burn more fuel.
     &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-9-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-10"&gt;
This varies dramatically with elevation; we get significantly better than this flying over the Antarctic Plateau, and worse around the coast.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-10-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-11"&gt;
    If you're at a coastal station, fuel is brought in on an ice breaker, and is less of a constraint.
If you're inland, that fuel is either brought in via a traverse (huge logistical operation) or flown in on LC-130s.
Last season, at WAIS divide, the United States Antarctic Program used LC-130s to bring us fuel.
They burn 3000 pounds of fuel an hour, and each delivery run from McMurdo provides enough fuel for ~3 of our survey flights.
     &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-11-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-12"&gt;
    Endurance is primarily a function of how much fuel can be carried.
The upper limit is neither the volume of the tanks nor the maximum weight that can get airborne - it's the maximum weight that the airplane can safely land with, if an emergency landing were required just after takeoff.
Nobody is going to be happy if you dump fuel over Antarctica.
This means that each additional passenger costs ~15 minutes of extremely expensive survey time, and has been known to be a factor in deciding which additional instruments to install.
Do you want the full suite of available instruments, or do you want an additional 30 minutes of survey time in order to reach that geologically interesting hole in the map?
     &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-12-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-13"&gt;
    Pilots have legally- and contractually-mandated maximum duty day lengths, days off, maximum hours in the air per day, and rolling weekly/monthly flight hour maximums.
     &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-13-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-14"&gt;
This was … tough.
The field camp was at an ice divide, meaning that weather systems could blow in from any of three directions, with very hard-to-predict timing.

That was before GPS, so the positioning was only good to ~5km, and the radar data was recorded photographically, not digitally! The technology didn't exist to digitize the received signals and write them to disk like we do now.
 &lt;a href="#sf-touring-utigs-airplane-15-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-touring-utigs-airplane-16"&gt;

We have recently learned that whale biologists are seriously interested in our data any time we fly over open water (which we do with some frequency for gravity data).
It turns out that they've been fielding airplanes &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; to get the same type of imagery that we collect as a routine part of our operations.

&lt;p&gt;I miss ROS.
I think that it should be the default choice for a new robotics project: rather than the discussion being framed as "Why ROS?", I want it to be "Why &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; ROS?"&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Reasons I've heard as to why people chose not to use ROS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;None of the drivers/higher-level packages apply to my project, so why bother?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hella-steep learning curve / I started the tutorials but couldn't see what was in it for my project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I use ROS, I'm committing wholesale to ROS and are stuck using their paradigm. You can't really grab the just bits of it that you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My project is too simple to need it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show that #1 is irrelevant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm not going to argue with #2. However, I'll try to convince you that the stuff you get by using ROS offers good enough default tools to give it a try despite #2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course, if #3 is truly a problem for you (other than at a philosophical level), you'll either know ROS's limitations better than I do, and have an exact reason that it's unsatisfactory for your application, OR be part of an existing team with the resources to have already developed mature middleware suitable for your project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quantify when #4 is true.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do I miss? (aka stuff I'd taken for granted until having to cobble together a non-ROS solution)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The messaging system. After having struggled with LCM for a while now, I highly prefer ROS's functionality. (I've only briefly played with protobufs, and am not familiar with any other systems. I'd love to learn about other competitors!) I'll get to the tools for examining messages later; what I'm referring to here is how the message handling actually happens. I find ROS's spinOnce() idea to be exactly what I want in a not-fully-callback-driven main loop. It calls all callbacks for messages already in the queue, and then returns control. (If it were to call callbacks until the queue is empty, it'll never return if messages come in faster than they can be processed.) LCM, in contrast, exposes a blocking handle() call, that calls a single callback.
I also like having the ActionServer built in. When designing more complicated behaviors, I often want a supervisory program to pass off control to another module, but with the option to monitor progress and cancel the goal. This is another thing that I expect to find myself re-creating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tf
The brilliant and simple idea behind tf is that all measurements should be tagged with the frame of reference that they were taken in relation to. Combine this with the idea that transformations between frames should also be published separately, and you get a utility that will let you translate data between any connected set of frames, as they were at any given point in time. I'm working on my own poor replacement, because I hate having to think about quaternions while working on what should be higher-level algorithms. There are also some nifty tools for debugging how you've set up the transform tree for your robot: visualize them in rviz, run tf_viewer, look at tf_echo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rviz (so valuable to be able to plot arbitrary messages in 3d)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time - If you use system time in your programs to determine timeouts, then as soon as you try to run them faster in simulation, you're in trouble. ROS handles this by ....&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rostopic. I'm using LCM right now (which could be a comparison post in its own right), and by its very nature it doesn't&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;config system (I'm meh about how they do it - I often find myself digging through tons of files to figure out where some parameter gets set and where all it could be overwritten. Still, writing your own distributed config system sucks; though a small enough project could probably use a simple yaml file)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;roslaunch - another one that I'm meh on. If you're running nodes on multiple machines, you want a single point at which to start them all. I'm not in love with roslaunch; I'd love a way to interactively start/stop processes, and to open up an xterm (without having to have set that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;smach - It provides a state machine framework that is very well matched to the needs of a roboticist who is trying to design behaviors and contingency plans. Huge props to jbohren for architecting it in such a way that I can use the core functionality on even non-ROS projects!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that these are features of the core system; even if I was working on a robot for which there were no drivers or path planning packages available, I'd still benefit from ROS.
Yes, I love that I can borrow a SICK laser scanner from another lab and have integration be trivial with my robot since good drivers exist within ROS, but that's just a bonus compared to how much work good-enough middleware saves you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, a bit about the bad stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find answers.ros.org to be enormously frustrating. Answering questions requires wading through large numbers of poorly-written and duplicate queries where the author hasn't put in the effort to ask a good question, and finding relevant questions is . There are plenty of resources to help write good questions; I wish that the admins would be more aggressive about encouraging people to improve their questions or have them removed. (I suspect that they've made a conscious decision to attempt to be more welcoming, at the expense of a less-useful Q-and-A site.)  (TODO: link to lots of different sites discussing that.). The search has historically been broken - use google with &lt;code&gt;site:answers.ros.org&lt;/code&gt; instead. However, the developers at OSRF do monitor it, and most answerable questions wind up with some attempt at an answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's monolithic. If you want to use ROS, you can't really go halfway. AFAIK, all of the tools are intimately tied to the messaging system, and you'll have to have a single machine running the master node. I briefly looked at trying to peel TF off, but settled for writing a poor clone of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, catkin. I've found the documentation to be confusing, and the errors cryptic. jbohren's tutorial really helps, but even in a team where everybody had been using ROS for years, it was common to lose hours to catkin. Catkin is the main reason that I didn't push hard for my current project to adopt ROS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The learning curve is a pain. I was lucky enough to get started with ROS by joining an established team already using it; this is definitely the easiest way =)
Tutorials are an awful place to throw a first-timer. I learned this the hard way, when trying to entice people to play with my robots at Hacker School. Even the motivated ones were turned off by the tutorials. I wish I had a better suggestion; the learning curve is steep, because it's a complicated system, but I wish there were a better place to point people for guidance in starting their own project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why shouldn't you use ROS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your system is simple enough that the added complexity isn't worth it. ROS isn't meant for the simplest hobbyist-type robots: If the sense-think-act loop can literally run in one process, ROS is utterly unnecessary. If you have only a few processes, it might make sense to just use LCM or protobufs for message handling. However, even in that case, ROS's better infrastructure for monitoring communications can speed up debugging, and the various plotting tools are still fantastic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You already know exactly why ROS won't work for you, and you have the resources to devote to developing all of your own middleware and tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're developing the next generation of robotics middleware - I'd love to see some competition!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, why haven't I pushed for my current project to use ROS?
In order of importance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;I'm the junior developer joining an existing team of 5, some of whom had been working on the code base for years. I didn't have a deep enough understanding of the system to confidently say that ROS would be good for this project, given our ambitious deadline and the inevitable ramp-up time.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Catkin.  I don't want to try to get 5 other developers up-to-speed on it, when I don't understand it well myself.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;I've realized that I default to assuming a ROS-like system when developing a robot - I thought I'd learn a lot by working on another project without it.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if the existing team starts a new project, I am optimistic that they will give ROS a much more serious look.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Field Processing for Ice-Penetrating Radar</title><link href="/blog/2015/09/21/field-processing-for-ice-penetrating-radar/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-09-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Laura Lindzey</name></author><id>tag:,2015-09-21:blog/2015/09/21/field-processing-for-ice-penetrating-radar/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Required Images / things to follow up on:

&lt;p&gt;I'm used to looking at radargrams like the one above and left. That's the format we use for field quality control and preliminary science (we call that data product ``pik1''), so I tend to think of it as the most primitive form of the data. Significantly more complicated processing occurs once we get the data back to our server. However, as shown to the right, the raw data coming off the airplane is much uglier. Incomprehensible, even. In this post I'm going to explore the (very basic, but still magical) signal processing involved in this transformation.&lt;sup id="sf-field-processing-for-ice-penetrating-radar-1-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-field-processing-for-ice-penetrating-radar-1" title=" I owe a huge thanks to my colleagues at UTIG who fielded my (still-ongoing) stream of questions about radar processing algorithms (and everything else). In working on the class project that turned into this post, I had numerous conversations Scott Kempf, Gregory Ng and Duncan Young. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Recall that the radar sends out pulses of energy at 6400Hz.&lt;sup id="sf-field-processing-for-ice-penetrating-radar-2-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-field-processing-for-ice-penetrating-radar-2" title=" This has varied over the years. 6408 from Peters 2007, ATRS has 6400 from Peters 2005, and I've heard 6250 somewhere. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
The sequential pulse numbers are the radargram's x-axis units, called &lt;em&gt;traces&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;sweeps&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;slow-time&lt;/em&gt;, and they roughly correspond to distance along the flight line.&lt;sup id="sf-field-processing-for-ice-penetrating-radar-3-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-field-processing-for-ice-penetrating-radar-3" title=" Since the plane's velocity changes, in later processing these will be converted exactly into position. " class="simple-footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Each pulse is sampled at a frequency of 50MHz a total of 3437 times.
We call these &lt;em&gt;samples&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;fast-time&lt;/em&gt;.
They're plotted on the y-axis of radargrams, and correspond to distance below the plane. &lt;a href=""&gt;This previous post&lt;/a&gt; goes into what is actually involved in collecting this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The radargram is simply an image showing how much energy was received at each sample of each trace, which images a virtual cross-section of the ice sheet.
One thing to keep in mind when interpreting these images is that light travels faster through air than ice, so by comparison, the ice will look thicker. I've previously &lt;a href=""&gt;described a little bit of what goes into interpreting this data.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual field processing is pretty simple in concept:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coherently stack 10 traces: boosts the signal to noise ratio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dechirp (and denoise): improves vertical resolution, sharpens interfaces, removes noise due to the local oscillator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incoherently stack 5 traces: removes speckle, further boosts SNR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of this post will describe each of these steps in more detail, with pictures! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--

Subtlety in applying this comes from:

* Understanding the scenario that we're operating in and using that to guide our parameter choices, such that we don't over/under stack.
* Understanding the artifacts that come from both the FFT and the electronic equipment, and working around / correcting for them.

--&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Coherent Stacking&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each trace that is recorded to disk corresponds to the data from 8 pulses, summed in hardware. 
Flying at 100m/s, this still corresponds to data every 12.5cm along the flight path. 
This is excessive if our goal is to create an image for human interpretation. 
Additional stacking boosts the signal to noise ratio, decreases data storage requirements, decreases processing time, and improves horizontal resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/common/penguin_tracks.jpg" alt="coherent stack depth = 1" style="width: 200px;"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/common/penguin_tracks.jpg" alt="coherent stack depth = 10" style="width: 200px;"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/common/penguin_tracks.jpg" alt="coherent stack depth = 100" style="width: 200px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the antennas' along-track beam width is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sim150^\circ\)&lt;/span&gt; and our airplane is hundreds of meters to several kilometers above the surface of interest, we don't expect any significant change in the recorded signal between adjacent traces. 
Therefore, simply adding &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; traces will in theory boost your SNR by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sqrt{n}\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;sup id="sf-field-processing-for-ice-penetrating-radar-4-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-field-processing-for-ice-penetrating-radar-4" title=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_averaging " class="simple-footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
For our application, this breaks down if the range to the surface changes enough to cause signals to destructively interfere.
Thus, the ideal number of traces to combine depends on the radar's wavelength and how quickly the range to the surface changes along-track. 
In the images above, the left has no stacking, the middle has 10 traces stacked, and the right has 100 traces stacked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/common/penguin_tracks.jpg" alt="Pulse-limited footprint" style="width: 300px;"&gt;
&lt;img caption="foo" alt="slope-limited footprint" src="/images/common/penguin_tracks.jpg" style="width: 300px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, we have found 10 to work well at this stage. If we were only worried about the pulse-limited footprint, we could in theory stack for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sim\)&lt;/span&gt;40m along-track (above, left).
However, surface slopes provide a stronger bound (above, right). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to increasing the SNR along a trace, stacking improves the along-track resolution.
This technique is also referred to as "unfocused Synthetic Aperture Radar"&lt;sup id="sf-field-processing-for-ice-penetrating-radar-5-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-field-processing-for-ice-penetrating-radar-5" title=" That textbook... It looked like additional details could be found in Cutrona1990, Raju1990 " class="simple-footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
 or "coherent integration."&lt;sup id="sf-field-processing-for-ice-penetrating-radar-6-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-field-processing-for-ice-penetrating-radar-6" title=" Peters2005 " class="simple-footnote"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Side Note: Coherence&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of radar, coherence refers to the ability to recover phase information about the signal. This is important for dechirping and focusing.
For a long time, this terminology confused me because I hadn't realized that "coherent" can be used to mean slightly different things when describing the instrument, the environment, and the processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the instrument level, coherence requires sending out pulses of energy where the phase is always consistent with respect to the start of the pulse. If you generated the output signal using an unsychronized oscillator and a blanking signal, you'd have an incoherent radar.&lt;sup id="sf-field-processing-for-ice-penetrating-radar-7-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-field-processing-for-ice-penetrating-radar-7" title=" Our current design uses a digital output at 200MHz to generate a chirped pulse.  " class="simple-footnote"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Coherence also requires sampling the returned signal at a high enough frequency to recover the phase information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the environment, a surface can either reflect energy with the same phase as it was incident, or can randomize the phases. A uniform smooth flat surface will be coherent, whereas one that's rough may be incoherent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, some steps in our processing pipeline retain phase information, and later ones operate only on amplitudes. Reducing different types of noise require coherent or incoherent techniques. The ordering is important since once you've discarded phase information you can't get it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--
We use *coherent* to mean a number slightly different things:

1. To describe a radar system that transmits pulses that always have the same phase offset from the start.
2. To describe an interface that reflects energy while preserving phase. Think a mirror. If a surface is rough, reflections from different points will vary in phase. 
3. To describe whether the receiver allows data to be sampled in a way that enables extracting allows phase information. 
4. To describe whether the processing applied to the data has preserved phase information.

(TODO: track down what was really different between SOAR and ASE1 w/r/t coherence)

1) A signal that's been sampled at high enough frequency and with good enough time resolution that we're able to obtain phase data.
=&gt; TODO: which was the hard bit in the old days? What time resolution do you need for it to work?

The old radar system (198x - 199x) (purple lines in above map) was incoherent. Adding phase information allows focusing (subject of a future blog post - it removes noise) and lots of other fun data processing techniques. So, it's very important that we sample the signal often enough to recover phase. 

2) The raw data, before dechirping, is "coherent" because phase can cause interference when summing adjacent traces. After dechirping, we have magnitude separated from the phase, in which case 
This limits how much we can stack - if the plane has moved enough that we expect a significant difference in range between features, excessive coherent stacking could cause destructive interference. 

&lt;img src="/images/common/penguin_tracks.jpg" style="width: 300px;" alt="Image showing this for idealized chirp returns: alternate pipeline of coh add -&gt; dechirp, or dechirp -&gt; inco add. Shift by 1/2 lambda between the two signals." \n&gt;
**TODO**: Come up with better way to demonstrate this. 

--&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Dechirping&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/common/penguin_tracks.jpg" alt="Show before/after dechirping data, single trace and radargram, superimposed" style="width: 300px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dechirping is a simple concept- just convolve the reference chirp along each trace. This means that a single peak in the returned data (corresponding to a change in dielectric properties in the ice, or an air/ice/bed interface) will be magnified by xxx dB. If an interface is strong enough, you'll also see the sidelobes in the convolution, as shown below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since convolution is distributive over addition, results don't depend on the ordering of the coherent stacking and the dechirping. Stacking first requires fewer computations, so we do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, this convolution is performed using a FFT and iFFT, since &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(F*H = iFFT[FFT(F) FFT(H)]\)&lt;/span&gt;, and a FFT is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(O(nlogn)\)&lt;/span&gt;, while convolution is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(O(n^2)\)&lt;/span&gt;. However, there are a few additional subtleties to the convolution in practice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give a pointer to http://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/sound.html for more details about basic signal processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Side Note: Why Chirp?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we transmit a chirped signal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use a chirped pulse because it allows us to greatly improve effective vertical resolution over a constant-frequency pulse. 
The diagram below shows an idealized example of trying to determine the range to a surface, based on the reflected signal.
For a constant frequency pulse, the best you can do is ????.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/common/penguin_tracks.jpg" alt="Image of trying to find the peak of a perfectly reflected chirp and constant-freq pulse" style="width: 300px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a chirp, effective vertical resolution is 1/bandwidth. For us, this translates to ??m in air, or ??m in ice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;reference chirp&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/common/penguin_tracks.jpg" alt="Image of signal as distorted by the amplifier. There were some big attenuators involved s.t. this didn't fry the oscilloscope." style="width: 300px;"&gt;
&lt;img caption="foo" alt="Image of chirp used for dechirping, overlaid on ideal pulse" src="/images/common/penguin_tracks.jpg" style="width: 300px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't actually use the idealized reference chirp from the signal generator; both the amplifier and the antennas distort the signal. (As does interaction with the air, and ice.) Instead, we use an empiricaly-derived reference chirp [I think this is pretty much just based on "what looks good". At one point, we tried to derive this from the reflection on open water, but that wound up just being a really good water detector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Denoising&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we can do better than simple deconvolution with &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;hamming filter&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/common/penguin_tracks.jpg" alt="Dechirped waveform with and without Hamming filter" style="width: 300px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the field, we'll use a hamming filter to make the resulting image clearer.
A hamming filter lowers the power of the sidelobes involved in dechirping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/common/penguin_tracks.jpg" alt="try to find and show super-bright surface or bed reflection, with and without hamming filter" style="width: 300px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Local Oscillator Leakage&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a number of years, our receiver design involved amplification, frequency mixing with a 70MHz local oscillator (to downconvert the 60MHz center frequency to 10MHz), low pass filtering, and finally, sampling at 50MHz.
    &lt;sup id="sf-field-processing-for-ice-penetrating-radar-8-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-field-processing-for-ice-penetrating-radar-8" title=" The new design entirely leaves out this downconversion, since the newer digitizers are precise enough for bandpass sampling works just as well without downconversion.      " class="simple-footnote"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
A very small amount of energy from this local oscillator made it through the system even when there was no signal from the antennas. This results in the horizontal stripes seen in the images above.
    &lt;sup id="sf-field-processing-for-ice-penetrating-radar-9-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-field-processing-for-ice-penetrating-radar-9" title=" The stripes we observe here are actually aliasing of the true signal due to subsampling in order to fit on the screen, as the frequency component that sneaks through the other processing has a period of 5 samples and a radargram is 3200 samples tall.     " class="simple-footnote"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't even show up in the FFT of the full image, but if we look at the spectrum of noise below the bed reflection we'll see them show up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TODO: Try plotting the FFT on a log plot?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hamming filter removes the highest-gain components, but we still have the harmonics that show up right in the middle of the chirp. These don't show up as stripes in the final data products, but instead raise the level of background noise, which directly impacts how weak of a signal we can detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This correction is very cheap - we've already taken the FFT in order to efficiently dechirp the data, so we just use the FFT of the noise (computed once per transect) to determine how much to subtract from the corresponding frequency bin of the full trace's FFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Older Data&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TODO: Images showing both old and new versions of TOT/JKB2d/X16a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This FFT-based noise rejection is a recent change in the processing pipeline. If you look at some of our older published radargrams, you'll see vertical streaks that are an artifact of the prior approach. In that version, rather than subtracting off a calculated amount from the appropriate bins, we simply replaced those values with an interpolation between neighboring bins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Hamming Filter&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TODO: Image showing the frequency spectrum of the chirp, aliased LO signals, and the hamming filter itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TODO: Image (zoom in on surface) showing how the hamming filter improves the sharpness of peaks. Maybe also show single traces ... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TODO: Comparison of different filters/windows: None, square, Hanning/Hamming, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Incoherent Stacking:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incoherent stacking is used to reduce data size (we generate products that are consistent with data from decades ago) and to reduce speckle. No amount of coherent addition will remove speckle - it just changes where the nulls are. However, as soon as you sum magnitudes the problem of phase interference causing nulls or peaks goes away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Side Note: Speckle&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TODO: I talked w/ Scott and Greg, and it's apparently a common phenomenon that happens whenever you have coherent signals adding - random scattering will cause interference, and you'll get zeros where they don't belong. You can see this if you look closely at a laser pointer's dot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Overall Complexity:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check these with a line profiler:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coherent Stacking requires one addition per sample per trace, so it's &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(O(xy)\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dechirping requires &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(O(\frac{x}{y} y log_{10} y)\)&lt;/span&gt; operations for the FFT where n is the stacking depth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;incoherent stacking requires &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(O(y\frac{x}{n})\)&lt;/span&gt; additions.     &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I owe a huge thanks to my colleagues at UTIG who fielded my (still-ongoing) stream of questions about radar processing algorithms (and everything else).
In working on the class project that turned into this post, I had numerous conversations Scott Kempf, Gregory Ng and Duncan Young.
 &lt;a href="#sf-field-processing-for-ice-penetrating-radar-1-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-field-processing-for-ice-penetrating-radar-2"&gt;
This has varied over the years. 6408 from Peters 2007, ATRS has 6400 from Peters 2005, and I've heard 6250 somewhere.

Since the plane's velocity changes, in later processing these will be converted exactly into position.

Our current design uses a digital output at 200MHz to generate a chirped pulse. 
 &lt;a href="#sf-field-processing-for-ice-penetrating-radar-7-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-field-processing-for-ice-penetrating-radar-8"&gt;
The new design entirely leaves out this downconversion, since the newer digitizers are precise enough for bandpass sampling works just as well without downconversion.

The stripes we observe here are actually aliasing of the true signal due to subsampling in order to fit on the screen, as the frequency component that sneaks through the other processing has a period of 5 samples and a radargram is 3200 samples tall.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/common/penguin_tracks.jpg" alt="Picture of JKB in flight" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short version is that we mount antennas under the wing of a ski-equipped airplane like the one above, stuff ~300 pounds of electronics inside
    &lt;sup id="sf-collecting-radar-data-in-antarctica-1-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-collecting-radar-data-in-antarctica-1" title="     300 pounds is just for the radar electronics, not the other instruments we use. The 8000W amplifier is the heaviest bit, followed by the ??? and the ???. I'm guessing pbat and actual electronics. Look at the packing spreadsheet!     " class="simple-footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,
and fly around Antarctica. The longer version made me realize how utterly amazing electrical engineering is. 
&lt;sup id="sf-collecting-radar-data-in-antarctica-2-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-collecting-radar-data-in-antarctica-2" title="     An earlier version of our system was described in Peters2005.  The current version is very similar. I've relied extensively on conversations with Gregory Ng and Duncan Young to learn about UTIG's radar.     " class="simple-footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Onboard electronics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schematic of the radar electronics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img p="" alt=" Diagram of the electronics. signal generator -&gt; amplifier -&gt; T/R switch -&gt; digitizer. This should include the downconversion, since I'll be talking about it later." &amp;gt;&lt;="" src="/images/common/empty_horiz.png" style="width: 500px;"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Signal Generator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/common/empty_horiz.png" alt="Show single chirp, with 200Mhz dots on it. " style="width: 250px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We transmit a chirped pulse 1us long, sweeping 15MHz centered on 60MHZ. Digital signal sampled at 200MHz; The above image shows the idealized output signal, along with the sampling. QUESTION: I assume the best way to draw it is as a histogram, since it locks on to the value?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use a chirp because it allows us to increase the effective vertical resolution of our radar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/common/empty_horiz.png" alt="Show to-scale timeline of transmitting/listening/nothing" style="width: 250px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The radar is pulsed at ???? Hz. This means that we "listen" for ???us between every pulse. In this amount of time, EM energy could travel ???km round-trip through air, or ???km round-trip through ice. Since this is far more than the thickness of ice in Antarctica, we don't have to worry about having mulitple pulses in flight at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image above shows the relative timing of all these events. Over the time shown in that plot, the airplane will have moved &amp;lt; ???cm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the amplifier. This converts a signal at ??? mW to one at 8kW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amplified signal is then sent to a ransmit/receive switch. This directs power from the amplifier out to the antennas, and energy back from the antennas into the receive electronics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antennas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/common/empty_horiz.png" alt="Pic of antenna being assembled in RAC tent, 2014" style="width: 300px;"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/common/empty_horiz.png" alt="Pic of our antennas on old airplanes" style="width: 300px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Antennas are dipoles - leads to very broad beam pattern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mounted 1/4 wavelength below the wings (for constructive interference? Is this what causes the stronger beam battern below the plane?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Older than the program - originally used on an LC-130 in the 1970's, as shown in above right. image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Receiver&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the transmitted pulse would saturate and damage the receive electronics, we have a bypass that goes directly from the signal generator to the receive, along with a blanking signal that indicates when to record from the T/R switch and when to record from the reference chirp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, we've summed the signals from both antennas before digitizing. We're currently experimenting with recording them independently, since relative phases between the received signals should provide some additional information about whether an echo is from directly below the airplane or off to the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The received signal is split into two channels each of which has a different gain (?? &amp;amp; ?? dBm)
    &lt;sup id="sf-collecting-radar-data-in-antarctica-3-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-collecting-radar-data-in-antarctica-3" title=" Decibels are a unit describing the ratio of two quantities. We're interested in power, and so use dBm: decibels with respect to 1mW, or 10*log_10(power/1mW)     " class="simple-footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Each has a xx-bit digitizer sampling at 50MHz.
    &lt;sup id="sf-collecting-radar-data-in-antarctica-4-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-collecting-radar-data-in-antarctica-4" title="     &amp;quot;But wait&amp;quot;, you might object, &amp;quot;the maximum signal frequency is 67.5 MHz, and a 50MHz sampling rate doesn't even come close to the Nyquist frequency!&amp;quot; Given that our bandwidth is only 15MHz, we can use the magic of signal processing to uniquely reconstruct the signal.      " class="simple-footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
This gives us an effective dynamic range of ???dB. 
I find it incredible that we transmit at 8kW, and the digitizers saturate at only ??dBm = ???mW. The noise floor is ~??dBm = ???mW. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gains on the two receive channels are tuned with following constraints:
  * the surface doesn't saturate on the low-gain channel,
  * there's sufficient overlap between the chanels to calculate accurate reflection coefficients across&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start recording xxns before the chirp starts, and take 3437 samples, of which we use 3200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;stacking: in order to reduce data volumes and improve the signal-to-noise ratio, we sum 8? consecutive traces in hardware and only record their sum to disk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this all look like mounted in the plane?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/common/penguin_tracks.jpg" alt="Pic of racks in plane, with pieces labeled. May wind up wanting the plane view, then close-ups of the racks from the RAC tent" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few pieces labeled above that weren't discussed in the block diagram of the radar system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GPI switch - when in the air, we get power from the airplane's engines. When on the ground, we plug in to station power or a generator. In between, we're powered by these pBats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GPS, IMU - in order to georeference our data, we need to know precisely where we are. We post-process data from these instruments once we're on the ground, at which point we have cm-level accuracy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RTQC - We are able to monitor the instruments while flying. This includes looking at a subsampled version of the de-chirped radargram discussed a few paragraphs down. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard drives - we record simultaneously to the hard drive on the RTQC computer and to external SSD drives. Ideally, we just carry the SSD drive back to the tent or office where we're doing data processing. Having to download 100GB of data from the computer onto a drive is an annoying delay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; UTIG radar history&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where I'd like to go into the evolution of our radar, including

Once I sat down and just did it, it took less than a day, including the time required to recreate my favorite theme from elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm now a big fan of Pelican - I'm finding it easy to set up, and easy to modify. I just switched from octopress b/c I prefer python to ruby, and pelican seems way more logically structured and easy to modify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, my distaste for web programming was overpowered by my distaste for using an easy-to-break tool and not knowing enough to fix it. 
One of the reasons I was avoiding this was because I didn't know where to start, and it seemed like there was so much stuff to learn, and I didn't know how it all fit together.
It turned out to not be nearly as annoying as I'd expected.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bit was really well documented elsewhere, and a ridiculously smooth experience. 
&lt;a href=""&gt;Set up the blog locally&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=""&gt;Push to github pages&lt;/a&gt;. Done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Themes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelican has a bunch of themes available. Just clone &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes"&gt;this repository&lt;/a&gt;, and change the &lt;code&gt;THEME&lt;/code&gt; variable in &lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I'm picky. I'd discovered the &lt;a href="https://leanpress.herokuapp.com/"&gt;leanpress&lt;/a&gt; theme for Octopress, but couldn't find a version for Pelican, and couldn't find an existing one I liked as much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, time to learn about CSS &amp;amp; HTML. It turns out that the basics are really, really basic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML is used to describe the content of the pages, and the links between them. The raw template files made sense without any additional knowledge. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS is used to describe how to format the content from the HTML. Reading the first few pages of the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started"&gt;Mozilla tutorial&lt;/a&gt; gave me enough to go on with. I'm still in need of a more condensed reference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;??? - provides additional markup tags for the HTML templates that specify how the content from the blog posts gets inserted. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it. All I needed to know to customize a theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with a pelican theme with similar logical structure (&lt;a href="https://github.com/Kdecherf/cleanelican"&gt;cleanelican&lt;/a&gt;, itself a port of the &lt;a href="http://macjasp.github.io/"&gt;cleanpress&lt;/a&gt; octopress theme), and copied over the css details from the octopress theme that I liked. This was tedious, but easy enough. I'm sure it could be prettier, but it works and I'm moving on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plugins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, now I have a pretty blog. But what if I want the ability to display &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\LaTeX\)&lt;/span&gt; or easier-to-insert footnotes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clone the &lt;a href=""&gt;pelican-plugins&lt;/a&gt; repo, then edit &lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt; to set the &lt;code&gt;PLUGIN_PATHS&lt;/code&gt; variable to wherever you put it, and &lt;code&gt;PLUGINS&lt;/code&gt; to be a list of which ones you want enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These operate on the ???html/markup??? to do stuff like better picture formatting or footnotes. 
The best bit is that they're written in python, so when it doesn't do what I expected or two of 'em clash, it's really easy to just open up the source code and see what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been working with ice-penetrating radar data for years, and I still think it's so flipping cool that we can see through kilometers of ice using radar.
This is possible because ice is mostly transparent to electromagnetic energy at radar frequencies.
We see reflections at the air/ice interface, within the ice where its properties change, and at the ice/rock (or ice/water) interface.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Over the last few decades&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, my group has collected airborne ice-penetrating data all over Antarctica:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
  &lt;img src="/images/what_does_radar_data_look_like/all_UTIG_0.png" style="width: 500px;" alt="UTIG flights"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to collect this data, we mount antennas and recording equipment on a modified DC3. These are unpressurized WWII-era airplanes that have been updated with new engines. The left image below shows JKB taking off from the Casey skiway; the right image shows one of my colleagues monitoring the instruments during a flight. As the plane flies, the radar transmits 6250 pulses every second.
After each pulse, it listens for reflected energy; this returned signal is what you're looking at in the radargram.&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/what_does_radar_data_look_like/JKB_antennas.jpg" style="width: 400px;" alt="platform's antennas" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/what_does_radar_data_look_like/JKB_racks.jpg" style="width: 275px;", alt="airplane's racks"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time studying radar profiles like the one below.
The x-axis is distance along the flight line, and the y-axis is height.&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In effect, we're looking at a slice of the ice sheet.
White corresponds to a strong reflection, and we can clearly see the surface and bed all along the transect.
This particular profile is running along the Totten Ice Shelf; it is highlighted in red on the right (zoomed-in) image below.
The star indicates the start of the profile.
Note how the bed signal gets weaker as we cross the grounding zone - radar energy reflects more strongly from water than from rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/what_does_radar_data_look_like/TOT.JKB2d.X16a_full.png" alt="TOT/JKB2d/X16a full transect"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/what_does_radar_data_look_like/TOT_JKB2d_X16a_2.png" style="width: 245px;" alt="context map zoom0"/&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/what_does_radar_data_look_like/TOT_JKB2d_X16a_1.png" style="width: 223px;" alt="context map zoom1"/&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/what_does_radar_data_look_like/TOT_JKB2d_X16a_0.png" style="width: 202px;" alt="context map zoom2"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Totten Glacier is interesting because it is losing mass relatively quickly, as determined by satellite gravity&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and  altimetry.&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Among other things, radar data is used in areas like this to better determine the location of the grounding line and to calculate the volume of ice in the drainage feeding an outlet glacier.&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Multiple Reflections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at radargrams, another thing to watch out for are multiple reflections, which can be confused for the bed or a layer.
These most commonly occur when the radar energy bounces back off the plane, to the surface, and back to the plane.
It is possible to distinguish such a multiple from a true layer because it is always the same distance below the surface as the plane is above the surface, which means that the multiple's apparent slope is twice that of the surface's.
An example of this type of multiple can be found in the Totten transect above.
Below, we have data from over the Ross Ice Shelf.
The ice shelf is thin enough, and the bottom echo strong enough, that we see multiples due to the radar energy bouncing between the ice's interfaces, as well as back off the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/what_does_radar_data_look_like/MIS.JKB2e.Y25a_full.png" style="width: 675px;" alt="MIS/JKB2e/Y25 full transect"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/what_does_radar_data_look_like/MIS_JKB2e_Y25a_2.png" style="width: 245px;" alt="MIS zoom 0"/&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/what_does_radar_data_look_like/MIS_JKB2e_Y25a_1.png" style="width: 223px;" alt="MIS zoom 1"/&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/what_does_radar_data_look_like/MIS_JKB2e_Y25a_0.png" style="width: 202px;" alt="MIS zoom 2"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Beam Pattern&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radar data can be more difficult to interpret than laser data because the beam pattern is not anywhere near as focused. This means that the energy received at a given point in space is not necessarily a reflection from directly below the airplane, as would be most convenient/intuitive to assume. On our airplane, the along-track pattern is a single lobe with half power at 152-degrees (below, left). Cross-track, the first lobe is at 22-degrees, and is only 2.4dB weaker than the main lobe directly below the airplane (below, right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/what_does_radar_data_look_like/jkb-geardown-side.png" style="width: 245px;" alt="side view of JKB"/&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/what_does_radar_data_look_like/jkb-geardown-front.png" style="width: 310px;" alt="front view of JKB"/&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/what_does_radar_data_look_like/beam_pattern_along_track.png" style="width: 345px;" alt="side view of antenna pattern" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/what_does_radar_data_look_like/beam_pattern_cross_track.png" style="width: 345px;" alt="front view of antenna pattern" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Figures from&lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, showing the antenna's gain in dB as a function of angle.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reflections from the side&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous radargram has an undulating surface that could be confused for the bottom of an ice shelf.
However, looking at a map, we can see that this region is either open water or sea ice. The location of the ice shelf's edge roughly matches the reflector's geometry, so this is actually the side of the ice shelf reflecting energy from one of the sidelobes!
Echoes off to the side aren't always so easy to interpret.
Here's a more confusing transect flying along a valley:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/what_does_radar_data_look_like/ICP2.JKB1a.F09T01a_full.png" alt="ICP2/JKB1a/F09T01a full transect"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of research groups are actively working on how to determine whether a signal is a side echo or originates from directly below the aircraft, but it's not yet a solved problem. Techniques that have been tried include recording from multiple antennas at the same time and comparing the phase difference,&lt;sup id="fnref:8"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or comparing the radar data to a known elevation map of the surface.&lt;sup id="fnref:9"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reflections from ahead/behind&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wide beam pattern along-track also means that a strong reflector will be seen long before/after we actually fly over it.
These show up as hyperbolas in the radargram, as illustrated in the cartoon below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/what_does_radar_data_look_like/hyperbola_geometry_jkb.png" style="width: 500px;" alt="geometry forming hyperbola"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crevasses are very good reflectors since a corner will reflect energy along the same path that it came in on.
They show up well in some regions of the Totten Ice Shelf transect above.
Man-made structures also show up as strong reflectors. In the radargram below, we see South Pole Station as a set of hyperbolas. Their peaks appear below the surface reflection because this transect didn't directly cross the station - it was about a kilometer to the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are existing processing techniques for dealing with a wide along-track beam angle that reduce the appearance of hyperbolas. The basic idea is that you've observed the same location from a number of different positions as you're flying over it, and can use that redundancy to figure out where the "real" reflector is,&lt;sup id="fnref:10"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but the details are a topic for another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/what_does_radar_data_look_like/NPX.SJB2.NPX02a_full.png" alt="NPX/SJB2/NPX02a" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The radargram above has striking layers which are also wonderfully useful for modelling the ice sheet. A lot of work is done to correlate layers observed in radargrams to ice properties directly measured from a drilled core. This is analogous to studying tree rings, but over a much longer time frame. There are ice cores from East Antarctica that provide a climate record for the last 800,000 years.&lt;sup id="fnref:11"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Once you have this correlation, and if you can trace a continuous layer across a region, you then know the age-depth relationship for the ice sheet. The deformation of layers also contains information about how the ice has been moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A colleague claims that no presentation about Antarctica is complete without a penguin. They're far too small to show up in radar data, but here's a picture of a pair from Shirley Island, near Casey Station:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was looking for extra storage space in the office the other day, and ran across a fantastic filing cabinet: the top three drawers had data on 3 different generations of tape: LTO3, which we're only just now phasing out for LTO6, one that looked more like a cassette tape, and one set of huge spools that were labeled "800Bytes per Inch", and dated from the early 1980's. The bottom drawer contained a few rolls of photographic paper - still smelling of darkroom chemicals! - with radar transects printed on them, dating from 1979.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We transmit a 1us chirped pulse, with a 15MHz bandwidth centered around 60MHz. We digitize the returned signal at 50MHz, and stack 32 traces before recording to disk. The recorded signal is dechirped and stacked again to create the images I'm showing here, but those are details for another post.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More precisely, both axes are in units of time - each column of the image corresponds to the information received from a single pulse of the radar, and the the rows are how much time has passed since the transmission.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The idea of setting up a coffee date with a stranger just because they work at a company that I'm interested in felt devious and mercenary and awkward - as though I wouldn't be straight-up asking for a job, but kinda-sorta hoping that they'd submit my name. I wish I'd had better examples of what networking looked like, or how it could lead to a job. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I still struggle with networking (I'm way too shy at conferences, not particularly active on any form of social media, tend to over-analyze follow-up emails), but I've realized that my adventures in intentionally piecing together a series of internships and short term jobs over the past few years are an example of how networking has worked for a recent grad who hadn't even realized that what she was doing counted as networking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the interest of giving concrete examples, here are some things that went well for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization 1&lt;/strong&gt;: I'd worked here before, years ago, and wanted to return for a short-term gig. It was a scary phone call to make, but I simply called my old mentor and asked if he had anywhere that I could be of use. After a few months of emailing, all the details came together and I wound up with an interesting project well-suited to my skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moral&lt;/em&gt;: Ask for what you want, somebody just might say yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization 2&lt;/strong&gt;: This one was the classic case where a professor had a contact in a company, and introduced a student in need of an internship to a recruiter looking for students. I had a great chat with the company, and would have taken the offered internship except for the problem that their bureaucratic rules were not a good fit with my timeline. Even after I turned down the immediate offer, the recruiter encouraged me to contact them again for a different internship cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moral&lt;/em&gt;: It makes profs look good to recommend good students to a company, so let them know you're looking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization 3&lt;/strong&gt;: There are only a few places in the country working on what I'm interested in, and this one sounded very appealing to me. I asked a friend if he knew anybody there. He didn't but he knew somebody who knew one of the guys I wanted to work with, and they were both willing to pass along the introduction. It turned out that this organization didn't have anything that matched what I wanted, but a collaborator at another institution did. I was this.close to taking a summer research position with the collaborator, working in my ideal role, until it fell through thanks to international bureaucratic fun. After our first attempt fell through, I visited his lab again, and was introduced to another potential collaborator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moral&lt;/em&gt;: Holy cow - 4 edges in the graph! It works like that?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, I knew that I wanted an internship, and had my eye on a few companies in the bay area. I also had a few weeks of vacation, and friends I wanted to visit. So … I flew up there, having already arranged to see my friends and actually meet the researcher at Organization 3. This led to three other leads: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization 4&lt;/strong&gt;: They consistently published job postings for internships, and I'd had my eye on them for a while, but had been procrastinating on sending in a cover letter. The friend from undergrad who I was staying with offered to introduce me, which led to an in-person interview on 2 days notice. While at that interview, I ran into &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; friend from undergrad who worked for a different group in the same company. I was roped into an impromptu interview with his bosses, who were also looking for interns, and wound up with offers from both groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization 5&lt;/strong&gt;: I had had a half-finished cover letter to this place sitting on my hard drive for at least 6 months, but hadn't had the guts to send it. It was my dream internship. A friend from grad school and I met for dinner, and he had interned there a year ago. It didn't even occur to me to ask for an introduction because while we had been in the same department, we only knew each other through extracurriculars. As soon as he heard I was looking for internships, he offered to introduce me to his previous boss. This contact moved too slowly for an in-person interview while I was in CA, but after two telephone calls I wound up with an offer that led to the best internship ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization 6&lt;/strong&gt;: I'd never heard of them, but the same friend from grad school worked there and was excited about the company. He set up an informational interview for me (again on a few days notice), and I had a fun day talking with the founders and some of the engineering staff. We wound up not taking it any further - they were an early-stage startup, looking to hire full-time staff immediately, and I was firm in wanting a time-bounded internship to aid in my exploration. However - their recruiter contacted me later, once they were stable enough to actually have intern positions open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moral&lt;/em&gt;: It's OK to say "this isn't what I'm looking for right now". "Not right now" doesn't have to mean "not ever".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moral2&lt;/em&gt;: "I'm in town now, can we meet in the next week" can be way more powerful than "here's my resume, I'm interested". I know that Organization #4 has a big pile of typical resumes/cover letters that they slog through, and I totally jumped the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization 7&lt;/strong&gt;: I went to a talk that I found stimulating - the speaker was working on problems related to what I was about to start a PhD on, but approaching them very differently. Afterwards, I milled around and eventually (awkwardly) introduced myself. As soon as I explained my interest, the speaker was effusively enthusiastic and invited me to visit her lab. This didn't go anywhere beyond a fun tour where I got to meet a number of research groups working in areas related to my own, but I include it as an example of how friendly people can be if you demonstrate an interest in their work, and how easy it was to get further introductions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization 8&lt;/strong&gt;: I first heard of them while working with Organization 1, and thought that their project was just about the coolest thing ever, and I wanted to work on it. I didn't know if they were hiring, but I asked my mentor from Organization 1 to introduce me to the CEO of Organization 8. I flew to town on my own dime to visit family and chat with the CEO, with the goals of finding out if the project was as interesting as I thought and of getting on his radar. A few months later, I visited town again, and mentor #1 invited me to attend a meeting with CEO #8 (and most of the rest of his company). At this point, I explicitly told the CEO that I wanted to work for him and sent in a resume, but the logistics didn't work out for me to accept a position until a few months after that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a fantastic two years where I accomplished everything that I'd originally daydreamed of when deciding to take time off from grad school. (I wound up working with #1, #4, #5 and #8.) In that time, the only thing that I applied to directly was Hacker School - for everything else, the first contact was an introduction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea if this is typical for what "networking" looks like for other recent grads, but I do know that I love my friends and that I have been very lucky. So far, for me, "networking" has simply been a side effect of keeping in contact with people I was going to hang out with anyways. Telling your friends that you're looking for a new gig doesn't have come across as a request for assistance - it happens naturally when updating them on your life, and that gives them an opportunity to help if they want to. I've also been surprised by how effective it was to openly and consistently state my goals and motivations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The people I've dealt with seemed to want to find a way that we could work together, even when my preferences were atypical: I had explicitly wanted short-term work, and turned down the longer-term gigs that were offered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I never encountered any rancor as a result of my saying "this doesn't fit with my goals right now - maybe we can work something out later?" In most cases, the other party very explicitly left the door open for future collaboration. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reflecting on this, I've flipped how I see an "informational interview". Rather than an ill-disguised attempt to be referred for a job, it's a request to talk to somebody who is working on something that I'm keenly interested in. When viewed that way, it doesn't feel at all mercenary, or like I'd be struggling to come up with relevant questions. Instead, it would be an excuse to have a conversation that's worthwhile and entertaining on its own. &lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>A Visual Chronology of Robots</title><link href="/blog/2014/11/01/a-visual-chronology-of-robots/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-11-01T04:22:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Laura Lindzey</name></author><id>tag:,2014-11-01:blog/2014/11/01/a-visual-chronology-of-robots/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was just updating my official resume, and felt like making a more fun version. Here are all of the robots that I’ve worked with and could find pictures of. In chronological order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/chronology_of_robots/bob.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Bob was Team Caltech’s entry for the 2004 DARPA Grand Challenge, which was a race across the desert for fully autonomous vehicles. I wasn’t involved in that competition, but we used the vehicle for a course project and in early preparations for the 2005 DGC while waiting for Alice to be completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005, I worked on a PID controller that calculated the appropriate steering and throttle/brake commands to keep Bob/Alice on the desired path. When I started working on this project, I’d assumed that the control theory would be the tricky part. Instead, I wound up spending most of my efforts characterizing/negotiating the interfaces. If new paths generated by the planner weren’t continuous with the robot’s current state, no amount of tuning the gains could fix the vehicle’s overall performance. This is a tricky balance of how far in front of the vehicle a trajectory should remain fixed: too short, and you get jerky control, too far, and your vehicle won’t be able to a avoid newly-detected obstacle. Similarly, if my output steering commands were too high frequency, we’d blow up the steering pump. Repeatedly. This led to negotiations with the vehicle team over how much responsiveness was worth sacrificing to protect the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/chronology_of_robots/alice-launch.jpg" /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
Launching for the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge
(Alice! Once you have a Bob, the next one has to be Alice.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice was Team Caltech’s entry for the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge, which was another desert race, and for the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge, which required following traffic laws while interacting with other cars/robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, my main project was a module that would use the 4 bumper-mounted lidars to track moving vehicles. I did this by segmenting the scan based on discontinuities, looking for L shaped segments in the 2D scan, and then associating nearby segments in sequential scans. By looking at the direction the segment was moving, I could determine which corner we were tracking, and use the corner coordinates for a more accurate representation of the vehicle’s location. I used a simple Kalman Filter to predict the motion of the vehicles when occluded, and even reassociate them with an existing track when they reappeared. The basic algorithm design was sound, but I struggled with the implementation, spending way too much time debugging. This experience made me realize that I needed to become a better programmer if I wanted to be a roboticist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/chronology_of_robots/modsnake.png" /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
They can also climb legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snake robots - used for a course project on reinforcement learning, where we attempted to learn gait parameters that would lead to more efficient locomotion.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(image from &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/HerbMugface"&gt;HERB’s facebook page&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HERB! I had a summer internship at Intel Research, working with their Home Exploring Robotic Butler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first project was to determine the relative calibration between a spinning laser scanner and a camera and use that to generate colorized point clouds. Once everything was calibrated, I designed an algorithm that used Markov Random Fields to predict the occupancy status of occluded areas. In other words, I was trying to predict that a glass is circular after only having seen the front of it, which is an important capability if you want your robot to be able to manipulate previously-unmodeled objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/chronology_of_robots/youbot.png" /&gt;
(Kuka youBot)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended the 4th BRICS research camp on robot software architectures, where we used these in the context of a navigation task. The goal was to develop an architecture that would allow the robot to switch between navigation by following waypoints (whose relative spatial layout could and would change) and navigation in gridmaps with a fixed geometry. I wrote a state machine that was in charge of switching between the different navigation modes, and a controller that followed waypoints in the order specified, with the constraint that the next one in the list had to be visible from the current one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/chronology_of_robots/lagr.jpg" /&gt; 
(LAGR)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was the technical lead for CMU’s entry into the TARDEC CANINE challenge. This was essentially a competition for robots to play fetch in the presence of moving obstacles. I designed the architecture that we used, and wrote the state machine that handled high-level control at each stage of the challenge. I also used this robot for a research project that investigated using Monte-Carlo Tree Search to plan paths that minimized distance traveled while maximizing information gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/chronology_of_robots/m3pi.jpg" style="width: 275px;" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/chronology_of_robots/sphero.jpg" style="width: 225px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;m3pi &amp;amp; Sphero - I wanted to play with robots at home and at &lt;a href="https://www.recurse.com/"&gt;Hacker School&lt;/a&gt;; this is what I could afford. I wrote a &lt;a href="https://github.com/lindzey/m3pi_ros"&gt;ROS driver&lt;/a&gt; for the m3pi, and put together a simple demo where it navigated between goal waypoints, using an overhead kinect to estimate its position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/chronology_of_robots/pr2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PR2! I had an internship at Bosch, working towards the far-off goal of having a robot clean up after me. Robot manipulation in clutter is an open problem; we hypothesized that if a human provided guidance for the initial segmentation, the rest of the task might become tractable. I designed and implemented a modular architecture for shared autonomy in the context of table clearing, with interchangeable human interfaces and segmentation algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/chronology_of_robots/baxter.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baxter! Also at Bosch. I didn’t use this robot for research, but it was involved in a prank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google car! Best internship ever. Some of the stuff I worked on even wound up in the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dk3oc1Hr62g"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; they released.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Features of a Successful Internship</title><link href="/blog/2014/10/28/features-of-a-successful-internship/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-10-28T16:58:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Laura Lindzey</name></author><id>tag:,2014-10-28:blog/2014/10/28/features-of-a-successful-internship/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Between my MS and starting a PhD, I did a few internships. One in particular stood out as a fantastic experience, and I've been thinking about what they did so right.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things my mentor did:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I showed up, he had a starter project in mind for me. It was a relatively concrete feature request that even had an interface stubbed out, which allowed me to get started immediately. It was also very well chosen as an entry point to the codebase - by the time I'd finished this project, I'd learned a lot and was in a much better position to work on production code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My boss explicitly told me to ask for help after being stuck on anything for 15 minutes. Left to my own devices, I'll always struggle for longer than that, and I found that having an explicit guideline like that made me more productive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My boss pointed me towards two things he wanted me to help improve (one in the simulation infrastructure, one in the production code), but I had a lot of freedom in deciding what the final solution should look like. He was also very receptive to suggestions I had for side projects: refactoring code, adding a related simulation feature, developing/improving library utilities, etc. I'd go to him for help prioritizing my work, but what I found interesting was also an important factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of my internship, my boss made me give a presentation. It was a pain, and preparing it ate up the better part of a week. However, I treated it like a job talk, and it was a great chance to show off what I'd gotten done. Better yet - it was well attended, including by people outside of my direct team. This was yet another example of the whole group making it clear that the work I did as an intern was valued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Culture:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code reviews! I care a lot about writing clean code, and it's awesome to have other people look at what I do and suggest how to make it better. This is not exactly something that's emphasized in most corners of academia. This particular group cared deeply (obsessively?) about the state of their codebase, and were always willing to explain why they thought a particular design was better. I learned a lot about writing production quality c++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They created a safe space for asking questions. Whenever I got stuck and went to somebody, they were patient and helpful. There's a huge difference in tone between "you don't know how to \&amp;lt;foo&gt;?!?" and "Oh! let me show you how to \&amp;lt;foo&gt;!", and I always encountered the second. After Hacker School, I've become much more aware and appreciative of such differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as I was pointed towards a piece of the production code to try to improve, the whole team quickly gave me ownership - bug reports, questions, and hallway conversations came directly to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn't matter that my technical suggestions came from an intern - if they were good and I could back them up, they got implemented (and people were generous with credit for ideas!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People consistently made a point of pointing out not only what needed to be fixed, but also what had been improved. After relatively minor fixes to some code, I got comments from the testers, my boss, my boss's boss, and my boss's boss's boss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it particularly telling how well people reacted to my committing code that introduced faulty behavior during crunch time. My boss's boss was very matter-of-fact when he emailed me about it. The general tone of our discussion was: "Yeah, bugs are going to happen. What could have protected us from this one?", and my boss tested and committed the quick fix I sent in from home. There was an utter absence of any blame, shaming, or other pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company-wide policies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they wouldn't tell me any details about what I'd be working on while interviewing, I at least knew who my boss would be and a rough idea of what his team was responsible for. Without knowing what I'd be working on, I wouldn't have been interested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On day 1, I had access to just about the entire company's codebase. This practically screams "we trust you." I've had friends in internships where they weren't ever allowed to see the main codebase - they were put in their own sandbox, and their mentors were responsible for merging in any changes. From now on, I'll be asking about this, and a case like the 2nd company would be an absolute deal-breaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They paid competitively. Not that I even looked at this when considering internships, but it seemed correlated with how the company regards interns. And, you can bet that it's one of the first things I mention to other students who ask about the lower-paying internship I had: "The people were nice, but you should know that Company B only paid 1/2 of what Company A did. So, if the projects are equally interesting to you, you can do better!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that most of my points boil down to working with genuinely nice people, who made it clear that they respected and valued my contributions. Within the general priorities set out by my boss, I had a lot of autonomy, and at no point did I feel like my role or responsibilities were limited by being just an intern. In writing out this list, it also struck me how many of these were things a mentor doesn't have direct control over - most were at the team or even project level.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Would I do Hacker School Again?</title><link href="/blog/2014/10/19/would-i-do-hacker-school-again/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-10-19T03:09:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Laura Lindzey</name></author><id>tag:,2014-10-19:blog/2014/10/19/would-i-do-hacker-school-again/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of our interview for the Hacker School study, &lt;a href="http://blog.leahhanson.us/"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt; asked me an interesting question: &lt;em&gt;Would you want to do Hacker School again?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, my answer is: &lt;em&gt;I loved it, but no, not right now. Programming is no longer the thing I struggle most with.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When I applied to Hacker School, my driving insecurity was that I wasn't a good enough programmer. I'd been in academia my whole life, and had struggled with producing code that would implement the algorithms I'd designed. As a graduate student in robotics, I put a lot of effort into fixing this (to the almost-derision of some professors, who saw programming as beside the point) because I didn't want my programming skills to be the thing holding me back as a roboticist. By the time I took time off and headed to Hacker School, implementation had stopped being so painful, but I still had never had a real job or worked with "real" programmers - only other academics, even if on admittedly-cool projects. I'd almost never had somebody look at my code and offer feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So - Hacker School was a great fit for my goals at that point in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did I get out of it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An awesome social atmosphere, very different from what I'd been used to. There was another student there who taught me a lot. She was quiet, and I had to give her space to talk because she would never take it. But, given the space, she turned out to be incredibly enthusiastic, intelligent and motivated. How many other awesome people have I missed, simply because I never gave them this space? This environment was very different from the louder and more aggressive places I'd learned to code. I've discovered that I prefer it that way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More confidence (reinforced by my subsequent internships) to just jump in and read the source code when something doesn't work as expected. I think that my tiny bit of work on byterun with &lt;a href="http://akaptur.github.io/"&gt;Allison&lt;/a&gt; was a turning point for that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A better understanding of my own motivations. Somehow, simply reframing the thought from "What &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; I do today?" to "What do I &lt;em&gt;most want&lt;/em&gt; to work on?" made me incredibly productive. As a graduate student, I have enough freedom to put this into practice!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A small glimpse as to how computers actually work. I'd been insecure about my knowledge of their internals, but worked through &lt;a href="/blog/2014/09/04/nand2tetris/"&gt;NAND2Tetris&lt;/a&gt; with a friend. Now I at least have a framework for asking more detailed questions, and wound up having some great discussions about compilers that would have been absolutely over my head before doing this course.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between Hacker School and a few awesome internships/jobs, I am more secure in my implementation skills. This has allowed me to discover new areas that I want to learn more about. My driving insecurities now include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Statistics. I want to feel better about quantifying errors on the data products I produce, and be able to rigorously interpret them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ice-penetrating radar. I'm not directly working with it, but the data I'm working on will be compared with radar data products. I don't yet understand the nitty-gritty of the signal processing involved well enough to understand its limitations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to effectively work as part of a team, with legacy code and very ambitious deadlines. What's worth dealing with vs. fixing (as a technical AND political decision)? Given high-level goals, how should we organize our efforts as a team to get there step-by-step?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current position as both a roboticist and a scientist allows me to improve in these areas, and I couldn't be more excited.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>NAND2Tetris</title><link href="/blog/2014/09/04/nand2tetris/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-09-04T23:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Laura Lindzey</name></author><id>tag:,2014-09-04:blog/2014/09/04/nand2tetris/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My most sustained project at Hacker School was working through NAND2tetris. I finished the whole course, with the exception of chapter 9, because I figured I didn’t need to write a game in Jack when I’d have to write an OS in it later. After seeing a current student ask for peoples’ experiences with the course, I realized that I had more to say than could fit easily in the HS chat program.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why’d I do it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to understand computers at a deeper level, and was insecure about being a roboticist yet not understanding how they work. I have programmed in C, but that’s as low-level as I’d previously gone. I’ve heard a lot of people whom I respect say that their compilers course is where they learned the most. However, when I was an undergrad, I skipped that one (along with Operating Systems) because I wasn’t actually a CS major and only audited the courses that sounded fun, like Algorithms and Decidability/Tractability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How’d I do it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Davis and I worked through NAND2Tetris in our batch. We didn’t really work together, but did help get each other unstuck (especially at the start - their hardware emulator had a few quirks) and tried to stay roughly on the same timeline. I found it valuable to have somebody else to feel accountable to for finishing a chapter =) It was also useful to try to explain the concepts to each other, because that’s how I learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think ~10 hrs/week is a reasonable amount of time to spend on it, and probably matches with what I averaged. (I skipped the video lectures and just read the book + used the slides for reference.) It’s also not something you have to &lt;em&gt;finish&lt;/em&gt;. Even if you only get through the first few chapters, well, you’ve learned about how computers work down at the hardware level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Was it worth it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of everything I did at Hacker School, I got the most out of this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a new appreciation for how interesting computers are … previously, I’d mostly viewed hardware (and compilers, and programming languages … really, anything other than higher-level robotics algorithms) as things that I’d prefer to learn as little about as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also feel like I have enough of an overview of how computers work at all levels to ask questions about what I don’t understand. For example, it opened the door for me to have some great conversations about compilers, while before HS I had a very fuzzy picture of what they even do. The simplicity of the system you implement means that it is very easy to come up with ways to extend the platform or design a new one. It could be interesting to try to move some more of the math into the hardware, or add features to the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAND2tetris is very much a guided tour, meant for an undergrad-level class. It aims to be a broad survey that’ll let the student figure out where they’re interested studying in more depth. The system you build is very carefully designed to be as simple as possible while still being a capable computer. There is very little design involved - the homeworks were more about understanding the provided design (or following the signposts) and implementing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worry that they may provide too much guidance, and that people can work through the assignments without really grokking them. This was especially true for the bytecode translator, which is possible to implement correctly without understanding why the features were needed. I wrote the code for this, but still had trouble remembering how to use the bytecode when I got to the compiler chapter. I often tried to start the projects without reading the final section in the relevant chapter (it always focused on the implementation, rather than the theory.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who would I recommend it to?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that the only pre-req for this course is an introductory programming course or two. At least, you need to program well enough that understanding the compiler’s operation is the tricky bit, rather than the actual implementation. So, if you were accepted to Hacker School the book probably won’t be above your level, but I did notice a dramatic difference in how much time different people needed for the problem sets based on how experienced we were with programming in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve already taken multiple classes covering microcontrollers/compilers/programming languages, it may be too basic for you (but might also be fun for tying everything together - I’d love to hear from somebody reading it from that perspective!)&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>m3pi ROS driver</title><link href="/blog/2013/10/15/m3pi-ros-driver/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-10-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Laura Lindzey</name></author><id>tag:,2013-10-15:blog/2013/10/15/m3pi-ros-driver/</id><summary type="html">&lt;!-- TODO: discuss conventional ROS interface that we're going for here? need to introduce it better! --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="../../14/robot-setup"&gt;Previously&lt;/a&gt; we got as far as communicating with the m3pi wirelessly. Now we're ready to actually write a driver that sends useful motor commands, and then interface it with ROS. There are a few components to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand ROS's conventions for how robots will be controlled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out the robot's inputs, and how to send them over serial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The math for converting the ROS message to whatever units the robot's controller understands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Conventions / Best Practices&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write robot specific driver that doesn't depend on ROS; write thin wrapper to control w/ ROS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cmd_vel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twist - what it means for 2D robot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0119.html"&gt;turtlebot-compatible&lt;/a&gt; is a good goal if your robot is large enough to mount a kinect; we won't immediately achieve that, since we're only implementing cmd_vel. We'll go for odom later (or maybe open-loop simulation?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;simulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Serial Interface&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, the m3pi boots into "serial slave" mode.
This is perfect, since it will allow me to control the motors.
See the p.49 of the &lt;a href="http://www.pololu.com/docs/pdf/0J21/3pi.pdf"&gt;m3pi manual&lt;/a&gt; for a complete listing of available serial commands.
There are also other features (using the display, built-in IR sensors, playing sound) that I'm not going to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relevant commands for the serial slave program are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'0x81' - signature - used for initialization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'0xC1' - left motor forward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'0xC2' - left motor backward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'0xC3' - right motor forward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'0xC4' - right motor backward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the motor commands takes a 1-byte argument, limited to [0, 127] ([0x00, 0x7F] in hex), specifying the desired speed of the motor.
In the &lt;a href="../../14/robot-setup"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; we established how to send such a command to the robot using python, so all we need to do is translate from units we care about into counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Unit Conversion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our input will be in m/s and rad/s,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the specifications, the maximum speed of the robot is 1.0 m/s in a straight line, which should correspond to an argument of 127 to both the left and right motor forward commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a ~8.2 cm wheelbase this translates to
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
1 m/s * \frac{2 \pi rad}{0.082 \pi m} = 24.4 rad/sec
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I tried to test these numbers, but the m3pi's path wasn't perfectly straight over multiple meters, and I couldn't count the revolutions at full speed =) Using only one wheel at max speed, I got roughly 2 rev/sec, which matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eventual input to the driver will be a ROS &lt;a href="http://docs.ros.org/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Twist.html"&gt;geometry_msgs/Twist&lt;/a&gt; message, traditionally on the /cmd_vel topic.
This specifies the desired velocity of the robot &lt;strong&gt;in the robot's frame&lt;/strong&gt;.
A differential drive robot like the m3pi can travel forward (x component of linear velocity) and/or turn about its vertical axis (z component of angular velocity). The other components will be 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for the translation component of motion, the wheel commands should be:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
v_R = v_L = 127 * v_{x}
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(v_x\)&lt;/span&gt; in m/s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the rotational component, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$v_{th}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;, in rad/s, we have:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
v_R - v_L = 127 * v_{th} / 12.2
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(Max speed requires the wheels to both be moving in opposite directions)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding them up, for a given &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(v_x\)&lt;/span&gt; (m/s) and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$v_{th}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (rad/s), we have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$
v_R = 127 * (v_{x} + \frac{v_{th}}{24.4})
v_L = 127 * (v_{x} - \frac{v_{th}}{24.4})
$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this has to be separated into pos/neg motor commands and rounded to an int.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Putting it all together&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a simple driver, we need it to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accept port to connect to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;attempt connecting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;send signature command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parse response&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;loop waiting for velocity commands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to structure the code as a class that connects to and controls the robot, with a separate ROS node that handles all the ROS connectiosn and uses an instance of that class to control the robot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In outline, it will look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;serial&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;m3pi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;disconnect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;set_vels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;lin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

In this one, I describe what I bought and why, and get everything set up to talk to the robot wirelessly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;My final shopping list:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 x &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kinect-Sensor-Adventures-Xbox-360/dp/B002BSA298"&gt;Kinect&lt;/a&gt;, $100 - mounted overhead, I'll use it both to track and localize the robots, and provide obstacle information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 x &lt;a href="http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/2151"&gt;m3pi&lt;/a&gt;, $150 each - these come pre-loaded with a motor controller that accepts wheel commands over serial. Perfect! I only have to write the driver that converts ROS commands to the appropriate format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 x &lt;a href="http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/2260"&gt;Charger&lt;/a&gt;, $50&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 x &lt;a href="http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/1003"&gt;Rechargeable Batteries&lt;/a&gt;, $2.40 each&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 x &lt;a href="http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/1339"&gt;Wixels&lt;/a&gt;, $40 each - easy way to get serial control over wireless. Another option is XBee; I found instructions for interfacing Wixel w/ M3Pi first, so went with these. They come with example drivers for one-to-one communication, acting just like a serial cable. I'll have to modify this for eventual one-to-many control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;soldering iron (borrowed from friend) - if you use Wixel + m3pi, you'll need to solder the sockets on. This is easy enough that it's probably OK if it's your first soldering project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Assembly&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The m3pi comes almost fully assembled, so this is pretty straightforward. Just out of the box:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/robot-setup/setup1-out-of-box.png" alt="yeah, yeah ... I messed up depth of field here" style="width: 450px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pull top plate off, and remove the LCD (both just require a firm pull):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/robot-setup/setup2-disassembled.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add recharageable batteries, put the LCD back on.
Add the 3 jumpers that directly connect the wixel's output pins to the motor controller. (They're the yellow bits on the right)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/robot-setup/setup3-jumpers.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're using a xbee, you can plug it right in to the m3pi. If, like me, you're using a Wixel, you have to attach the proper socket. They come already in the right length - fit them to the wixel's leads, and attach to board as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/robot-setup/setup6-ready-to-solder.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the underside - the sloppy green boxes outline where I'll be soldering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/robot-setup/setup7-half-done.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once done with that, attach the long bolts w/ plastic spacers (sorry! I have no idea what they're actually called!), and you're ready to charge and test your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/robot-setup/setup9-finished.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Charging&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a good thread &lt;a href="http://forum.pololu.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;amp;t=6598"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on the charging setup I'm using. The important bits are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure the charger is set to "NiMH 0.9A"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be sure to plug the connecter in the right way!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold down "Start/Enter" to start; it'll beep when done; hold down "Batt.Type/Stop" to stop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/robot-setup/setup8-charging.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Wireless communication&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;!-- Screen shots of this process! AND Pics of my whole setup (computer on floor) --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the &lt;a href="http://www.pololu.com/docs/0J46/9.b"&gt;wireless-serial-v1.3.wxl app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plug in wixel to computer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start up &lt;a href="http://www.pololu.com/docs/0J46/3"&gt;Pololu Wixel Configuration Utility&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;select the wixel serial number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;click &lt;code&gt;open...&lt;/code&gt;, and select the "wireless-serial" file you downloaded&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For both wixels, use 115200 for the baud_rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for the on-robot wixel, use serial_mode 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for the computer's wixel, use serial_mode 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everything else can stay as the default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;click &lt;code&gt;Write to Wixel &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test that it worked, let's send the initialization command: '0x81', and look at the output.
First, figure out where the wixel shows up on your computer. This will be something like &lt;code&gt;/dev/ttyACM0&lt;/code&gt; (on Ubuntu) or &lt;code&gt;/dev/cu.usbmodemfa121&lt;/code&gt; (on my mac).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in python:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this doesn't work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may have to change the permissions on the port first: &lt;code&gt;sudo chmod a+wrx /dev/ttyACM0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take a multimeter and check that your solder joints are good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's also possible to attach two wixels to the same computer and see if they can talk to each other w/o the robot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Maybe "miracle" of robots would be better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways - I earned a M.S. in Robotics with an entirely theoretical project on multirobot manipulation. It involved high-level planning algorithms, but never considered how to implement them in the uncertainty of the real world. I didn't even have a suitable robot testbed to implement it on! I've since moved on to more practical projects, but in the back of my mind have been wanting to see a bunch of little robots running around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, I need to create my own robot herd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also noticed a number of hobbyists showing up on answers.ros.org, wanting to get started in robotics. This is great! I know of lots of web sites out there focusing on the hardware/electrical issues involved in building a robotic platform, but haven't found a great one for what to do after you have such a platform. So, I plan to document what I'm doing to get these robots up and running, and give a tour of what I consider to be some fundamental algorithms in robotics along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My interest is mainly in the software design and system integration; I need a robot embodied in the world to get all the fun uncertainty and unexpected interactions that are a large part of why I find robotics so interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads me to my main tradeoff: a fully-autonomous, self-contained robot that is capable of running sophisticated algorithms is often large and expensive, mostly due to the need for onboard computation and power. Yes, you can do amazing things on microcontrollers nowadays, but for this project I want to focus on algorithm design and not on porting it to a smaller chip. So - I'm willing to do offboard sensing and computation, only sending the control inputs to the robots. Think of it as a poor man's version of UPenn's famous quadcopters, which use motion capture and offboard computing to implement amazing feats of coordination and control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that a single overhead kinect will allow me to both track the robots and capture information about the environment. I'm willing to cheat by using augmented reality tags to make tracking easier. The biggest compromise here is that this limits my workspace to the size of the camera's field of view. If the kinect's resolution is insufficient for tracking, or forces a too-small workspace, I'll use a kinect for object detection and a higher-resolution webcam for robot tracking, with a relative calibration obtained by imaging static markers in the environment. This setup will even allow me to spoof sensor data as though it came from the robot; if I assume that the world has no overhangs, I should be able to determine what would be visible in a ground-parallel laser scan taken from the robot's point of view. Of course, the noise model won't be the same as for a typical laser range finder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I want to minimize the hardware/embedded hacking that I have to do in order to get to the point where I'm controlling the robot wirelessly with a ROS node, I've looked at off-the-shelf robots, preferably with a simple motor controller already included. It needs to be cheap enough for me to buy lots of (which rules out a lot of the more interesting platforms), and small enough that I can operate multiple robots in a ~2m x 2m workspace. For now, I'm going to experiment with Pololu's &lt;a href="http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/2151"&gt;m3pi&lt;/a&gt;. It even has the advantage of being circular, making configuration space calculations easier =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note - I think TurbleBots are great, and exactly what I'd recommend for somebody looking for a self-contained robot. With any luck, I'll play with one soon. However, they're both too big and too expensive for what I need in this project.&lt;/p&gt;
