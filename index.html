<p>I've been working with ice-penetrating radar data for years, and I still think it's so flipping cool that we can see through kilometers of ice using radar.
This is possible because ice is mostly transparent to electromagnetic energy at radar frequencies. 
We see reflections at the air/ice interface, within the ice where its properties change, and at the ice/rock (or ice/water) interface. <a class="read-more" href="/blog/2015/07/27/a-brief-introduction-to-ice-penetrating-radar/"><span> Read on &#8594; </span></a></p>

          <p>As a student, I often heard that "networking" was the way to get a job. I didn't have a clear picture of what it involved, other than the oft-cited advice of "invite people at your target company out for an informational interview over coffee."  The idea of setting up a coffee date with a stranger just because they work at a company that I'm interested in felt devious and mercenary and awkward - as though I wouldn't be straight-up asking for a job, but kinda-sorta hoping that they'd submit my name. I wish I'd had better examples of what networking looked like, or how it could lead to a job. <a class="read-more" href="/blog/2014/11/11/what-does-networking-look-like/"><span> Read on &#8594; </span></a></p>

          <p>My most sustained project at Hacker School was working through NAND2tetris. I finished the whole course, with the exception of chapter 9, because I figured I didn&#8217;t need to write a game in Jack when I&#8217;d have to write an OS in it later. After seeing a current student ask for peoples&#8217; experiences with the course, I realized that I had more to say than could fit easily in the HS chat program.<a class="read-more" href="/blog/2014/09/04/nand2tetris/"><span> Read on &#8594; </span></a></p>
