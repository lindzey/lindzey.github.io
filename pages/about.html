<div class="entry-content"><p>I am an ex-physics-major turned roboticist. The first real computer program I ever wrote was the controller responsible for turning desired paths into steering and throttle/brake commands for Alice, Caltech’s entry into the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge. After that, I was hooked. Since then, I’ve been privileged to play with <a href="/blog/2014/11/01/a-visual-chronology-of-robots/">a lot of robots</a>.</p>
<p>I am particularly drawn to field robotics, and have discovered that I’m happiest when I’m applying my engineering skills towards answering questions that I believe to be important. This has motivated me to seek a career for myself at the intersection of robotics and science.</p>
<p>So, I’m now also an aspiring geophysicist. I just started a PhD at UT Austin with the goal of obtaining a better grounding in the science questions and an understanding of where robotic platforms are most needed. Being a beginner again turns out to be a lot of fun. I love that my research requires me to learn about topics ranging from models of ocean circulation and ice-shelf collapse to the physics behind ice-penetrating radar, underwater sonar and photon-counting lidar.</p></div>
