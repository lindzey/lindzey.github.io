	<h2 class="title">What Does Networking Look Like?</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>As a student, I often heard that &ldquo;networking&rdquo; was the way to get a job. I didn&rsquo;t have a clear picture of what it involved, other than the oft-cited advice of &ldquo;invite people at your target company out for an informational interview over coffee.&rdquo;  The idea of setting up a coffee date with a stranger just because they work at a company that I&rsquo;m interested in felt devious and mercenary and awkward - as though I wouldn&rsquo;t be straight-up asking for a job, but kinda-sorta hoping that they&rsquo;d submit my name. I wish I&rsquo;d had better examples of what networking looked like, or how it could lead to a job.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I still struggle with networking (I&rsquo;m way too shy at conferences, not particularly active on any form of social media, tend to over-analyze follow-up emails), but I&rsquo;ve realized that my adventures in intentionally piecing together a series of internships and short term jobs over the past few years are an example of how networking has worked for a recent grad who hadn&rsquo;t even realized that what she was doing counted as networking.</p>

<p>So, in the interest of giving concrete examples, here are some things that went well for me:</p>

<p><strong>Organization 1</strong>: I&rsquo;d worked here before, years ago, and wanted to return for a short-term gig. It was a scary phone call to make, but I simply called my old mentor and asked if he had anywhere that I could be of use. After a few months of emailing, all the details came together and I wound up with an interesting project well-suited to my skills.</p>

<p><em>Moral</em>: Ask for what you want, somebody just might say yes.</p>

<p><strong>Organization 2</strong>: This one was the classic case where a professor had a contact in a company, and introduced a student in need of an internship to a recruiter looking for students. I had a great chat with the company, and would have taken the offered internship except for the problem that their bureaucratic rules were not a good fit with my timeline. Even after I turned down the immediate offer, the recruiter encouraged me to contact them again for a different internship cycle.</p>

<p><em>Moral</em>: It makes profs look good to recommend good students to a company, so let them know you&rsquo;re looking!</p>

<p><strong>Organization 3</strong>: There are only a few places in the country working on what I&rsquo;m interested in, and this one sounded very appealing to me. I asked a friend if he knew anybody there. He didn&rsquo;t but he knew somebody who knew one of the guys I wanted to work with, and they were both willing to pass along the introduction. It turned out that this organization didn&rsquo;t have anything that matched what I wanted, but a collaborator at another institution did. I was this.close to taking a summer research position with the collaborator, working in my ideal role, until it fell through thanks to international bureaucratic fun. After our first attempt fell through, I visited his lab again, and was introduced to another potential collaborator.</p>

<p><em>Moral</em>: Holy cow - 4 edges in the graph! It works like that?!</p>

<p>Later, I knew that I wanted an internship, and had my eye on a few companies in the bay area. I also had a few weeks of vacation, and friends I wanted to visit. So â€¦ I flew up there, having already arranged to see my friends and actually meet the researcher at Organization 3. This led to three other leads:</p>

<p><strong>Organization 4</strong>: They consistently published job postings for internships, and I&rsquo;d had my eye on them for a while, but had been procrastinating on sending in a cover letter. The friend from undergrad who I was staying with offered to introduce me, which led to an in-person interview on 2 days notice. While at that interview, I ran into <em>another</em> friend from undergrad who worked for a different group in the same company. I was roped into an impromptu interview with his bosses, who were also looking for interns, and wound up with offers from both groups.</p>

<p><strong>Organization 5</strong>: I had had a half-finished cover letter to this place sitting on my hard drive for at least 6 months, but hadn&rsquo;t had the guts to send it. It was my dream internship. A friend from grad school and I met for dinner, and he had interned there a year ago. It didn&rsquo;t even occur to me to ask for an introduction because while we had been in the same department, we only knew each other through extracurriculars. As soon as he heard I was looking for internships, he offered to introduce me to his previous boss. This contact moved too slowly for an in-person interview while I was in CA, but after two telephone calls I wound up with an offer that led to the best internship ever.</p>

<p><strong>Organization 6</strong>: I&rsquo;d never heard of them, but the same friend from grad school worked there and was excited about the company. He set up an informational interview for me (again on a few days notice), and I had a fun day talking with the founders and some of the engineering staff. We wound up not taking it any further - they were an early-stage startup, looking to hire full-time staff immediately, and I was firm in wanting a time-bounded internship to aid in my exploration. However - their recruiter contacted me later, once they were stable enough to actually have intern positions open.</p>

<p><em>Moral</em>: It&rsquo;s OK to say &ldquo;this isn&rsquo;t what I&rsquo;m looking for right now&rdquo;. &ldquo;Not right now&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t have to mean &ldquo;not ever&rdquo;.</p>

<p><em>Moral2</em>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in town now, can we meet in the next week&rdquo; can be way more powerful than &ldquo;here&rsquo;s my resume, I&rsquo;m interested&rdquo;. I know that Organization #4 has a big pile of typical resumes/cover letters that they slog through, and I totally jumped the line.</p>

<p><strong>Organization 7</strong>: I went to a talk that I found stimulating - the speaker was working on problems related to what I was about to start a PhD on, but approaching them very differently. Afterwards, I milled around and eventually (awkwardly) introduced myself. As soon as I explained my interest, the speaker was effusively enthusiastic and invited me to visit her lab. This didn&rsquo;t go anywhere beyond a fun tour where I got to meet a number of research groups working in areas related to my own, but I include it as an example of how friendly people can be if you demonstrate an interest in their work, and how easy it was to get further introductions.</p>

<p><strong>Organization 8</strong>: I first heard of them while working with Organization 1, and thought that their project was just about the coolest thing ever, and I wanted to work on it. I didn&rsquo;t know if they were hiring, but I asked my mentor from Organization 1 to introduce me to the CEO of Organization 8. I flew to town on my own dime to visit family and chat with the CEO, with the goals of finding out if the project was as interesting as I thought and of getting on his radar. A few months later, I visited town again, and mentor #1 invited me to attend a meeting with CEO #8 (and most of the rest of his company). At this point, I explicitly told the CEO that I wanted to work for him and sent in a resume, but the logistics didn&rsquo;t work out for me to accept a position until a few months after that.</p>

<p>I had a fantastic two years where I accomplished everything that I&rsquo;d originally daydreamed of when deciding to take time off from grad school. (I wound up working with #1, #4, #5 and #8.) In that time, the only thing that I applied to directly was Hacker School - for everything else, the first contact was an introduction.</p>

<p>I have no idea if this is typical for what &ldquo;networking&rdquo; looks like for other recent grads, but I do know that I love my friends and that I have been very lucky. So far, for me, &ldquo;networking&rdquo; has simply been a side effect of keeping in contact with people I was going to hang out with anyways. Telling your friends that you&rsquo;re looking for a new gig doesn&rsquo;t have come across as a request for assistance - it happens naturally when updating them on your life, and that gives them an opportunity to help if they want to. I&rsquo;ve also been surprised by how effective it was to openly and consistently state my goals and motivations:</p>

<ul>
<li>The people I&rsquo;ve dealt with seemed to want to find a way that we could work together, even when my preferences were atypical: I had explicitly wanted short-term work, and turned down the longer-term gigs that were offered.</li>
<li>I never encountered any rancor as a result of my saying &ldquo;this doesn&rsquo;t fit with my goals right now - maybe we can work something out later?&rdquo; In most cases, the other party very explicitly left the door open for future collaboration.</li>
</ul>


<p>After reflecting on this, I&rsquo;ve flipped how I see an &ldquo;informational interview&rdquo;. Rather than an ill-disguised attempt to be referred for a job, it&rsquo;s a request to talk to somebody who is working on something that I&rsquo;m keenly interested in. When viewed that way, it doesn&rsquo;t feel at all mercenary, or like I&rsquo;d be struggling to come up with relevant questions. Instead, it would be an excuse to have a conversation that&rsquo;s worthwhile and entertaining on its own.</p>
